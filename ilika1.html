            <p>A smart device is an electronic gadget which is used to reduce human efforts and time consumption.</p>
                <p>But why SMART?? </p>
                 <p>Well the “smart” is for being fast and intelligent, that is, having computational powers of its own.</p>
                
                <p>These devices are also capable of communicating within themselves through wireless protocols such as Bluetooth, LTE, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Internet, and the like.</p>
                
               <p>Bluetooth speakers and headphones are good examples of smart devices without interference of the Internet.
                </p>
            <p>Smart devices are typically composed of: Hardware layer, Network layer, Application layer</p><p>The Hardware layer consists of the microcontroller, that is, the brain of the device which can be programmed according to the requirements of the project.
                The hardware also contains the sensors and actuators which help to take the input data and give the output respectively, after certain computation by the microcontroller.
                </p>

        <div class="container__text">
          <p>Next comes the Network layer along with the internet connection; this layer contains the gateway and the cloud.
            A gateway is a bridge between iot hardware and the internet.
            
            Here you should also know that the cloud interconnected network of powerful servers which provides services to for the business and people 
            Generally something that happens in the cloud is an is any activity that takes place over and internet connection instead of the device itself 
            </p>
          <p>The Application layer is responsible for providing services and determines a set of protocols for message passing at the application level . Precisely, an application layer protocol is the messaging protocol that these IoT devices use to transport data. </p>
      <p>Iot or the internet of things is nothing but a group of smart devices connected to each other by means of the internet.

        All IoT devices are smart that is we can communicate wirelessly
        
        The difference between IoT device and a smart device is that a smart device can be accessed locally within limited range while iot devices can be accessed globally via internet either through internet or optic fibres WAN 
        
        
        According to Wikipedia, 
        Internet of things is a system of interrelated computing devices with unique identifiers and evolution of transfer the data over the network without requiring human to human or human to computer interaction.

          <p>What is the need of iot?
            We still had devices before the age of the internet.
            The disadvantage of the earlier days was that we have to move physically from machine to machine in order to coordinate with the use of iot we can interact, elaborate and learn from the experience just as humans.
            
            The machines are hence intelligent enough to make their own decisions with the help of  available data and learning experiences that can modify and adapt accordingly.
            </p>
          
          <p>The hardware contains the sensors and actuators along with the device. The sensors can be like IR sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor ,water level sensor, ultrasonic sensor, heat and motion sensor, accelerometer GPS module and the like.



            Actuators are the mechanical moving parts of the device. It basically converts the electrical impulses given by the device to physical output. 
            
            The examples of actuators are different ranges of motors used for different purposes and cases.
            </p>
          <p>In order to understand the functionality of the hardware layer it can be correlated and identified with the functioning of a human body.

            The human body senses the outside environment and sends the signal to the brain and the brain acts accordingly by movement or actions as required.
            
            Similarly, in the hardware the signal generated by the sensors are sent to the microcontroller or the brain to initialise the actuators to perform the action as and when required.
            </p>
            <p>The Google Home and Amazon Echo are popular in iot devices and act as an assistant which enables Home automation.

                They assist in day to day activities by voice recognition in form of commands.
                You can access all other enabled devices through them conveniently.
                
                These home assistants are enabled with Artificial Intelligence, so that they can be a part of your family and adjust the functionality as per requirements.
                
                </p>
                <p>August Doorbell Cam is another trendy topic now which can be used as a home security guard who sends a notification to the authorised person of someone arriving at the doorstep.
                    As the name suggests, it is a doorbell with camera and microphone along with speakers enabling one to one conversation between the host and the guest.
                    This feature is enabled with the help of the internet so that we can access it globally.
                    
                    Further features may be added to this device so that the permission of entry will be enabled and  the guest can enter with a smart door lock. 
                    This sort of device is really useful for the old and disabled people.
                    
                    
                    The application of these can be implemented and soon will be a part of our lifestyle
                    </p>
                    <p>Our summers can be cooler and winters can be warmer with very less effort of successfully using iot enabled thermostat which follows and learns your preferences and acts desirably.

                    </p>
                    <p>The efficient use of iot devices can be seen in the area of medical science in this era of social distancing owing to coronavirus. We can depend on these devices successfully for treating the patients from their homes under the strict supervision of a medical professional.</p>
