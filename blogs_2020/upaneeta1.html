        Hey there, all the would-be coders. Welcome to the programming world. By
        the term "would-be coders", I refer to all the newbies and to those
        people for whom coding still seems to be a magic-like thing. I just want
        to say that coding is not at all a herculean task. Learning programming
        seems difficult to many, often because of the wrong approach. But it can
        be fun if done the right way.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Needless to say, coding is the most sought-after skill today. It has
        exploded in recent years changing from something used in computer games
        and some electronic devices to something which shapes the way we live in
        this modern tech world.

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        However, this article doesn't at all focus on how important programming
        is, rather it reflects on how to get started with programming. So, let's
        begin.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-6"><b>What is Programming? </b></p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Basically, programming is the process of creating instructions that tell
        a computer what to do and how to do.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-6"><b>The Approach:</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        ● Different programming languages are used for different functionalities
        and it is needed to be familiar with several of them rather than just a
        specific one. For example, if one is interested in creating websites,
        he/she needs to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. But since we can't
        start our learning with all languages so we, as a first task, need to
        choose a particular language to begin with and download a code editor or
        a compiler for the practice.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        ● After you choose a language, start learning the basics of the
        language. In this era, learning something is not at all a matter of
        concern since thousands of materials and resources are available online.
        Books too are very helpful in this regard. You can try certain online
        courses also. After learning the basics go for the Data Structures and
        Algorithm part of the language.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        ● The next step is practice. Unless you get your hands dirty with coding
        practice, you won't be confident enough. You can practice at various
        online platforms such as hackerrank codechef etc. To have a grip on the
        language, do projects.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6"><b>Tips</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        ● There is no such thing as best language. As a beginner, language
        doesn't play a vital role but getting familiar with the way, how a
        programmer thinks, does. So, you can choose C, C++, Java, Python or any
        other language of your choice.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        ● Find other peoples' code and study it to make sure you understand what
        each item is and how it works. Look for ways you can change or improve
        things.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        ● Join communities or groups where you can discuss your ideas with
        like-minded people. You can also attend various workshops so that
        different ideas can cultivate in your mind.
      </p>

            rather than from books."

        >
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">- Alan Turing</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        True to Alan Turing's words, more and more practice will make you
        perfect.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">

          >So, what are you waiting for? Let's get started! It's too much fun!
          Happy coding!!
