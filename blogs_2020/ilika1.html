      <p>But why SMART??</p>
      <p>
        Well the “smart” is for being fast and intelligent, that is, having
        computational powers of its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        These devices are also capable of communicating within themselves
        through wireless protocols such as Bluetooth, LTE, Wi-Fi, Zigbee,
        Internet, and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bluetooth speakers and headphones are good examples of smart devices
        without interference of the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smart devices are typically composed of: Hardware layer, Network layer,
        Application layer
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hardware layer consists of the microcontroller, that is, the brain
        of the device which can be programmed according to the requirements of
        the project. The hardware also contains the sensors and actuators which
        help to take the input data and give the output respectively, after
        certain computation by the microcontroller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next comes the Network layer along with the internet connection; this
        layer contains the gateway and the cloud. A gateway is a bridge between
        iot hardware and the internet. Here you should also know that the cloud
        interconnected network of powerful servers which provides services to
        for the business and people Generally something that happens in the
        cloud is an is any activity that takes place over and internet
        connection instead of the device itself
      </p>
      <p>
        The Application layer is responsible for providing services and
        determines a set of protocols for message passing at the application
        level . Precisely, an application layer protocol is the messaging
        protocol that these IoT devices use to transport data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iot or the internet of things is nothing but a group of smart devices
        connected to each other by means of the internet. All IoT devices are
        smart that is we can communicate wirelessly The difference between IoT
        device and a smart device is that a smart device can be accessed locally
        within limited range while iot devices can be accessed globally via
        internet either through internet or optic fibres WAN According to
        Wikipedia, Internet of things is a system of interrelated computing
        devices with unique identifiers and evolution of transfer the data over
        the network without requiring human to human or human to computer
        interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the need of iot? We still had devices before the age of the
        internet. The disadvantage of the earlier days was that we have to move
        physically from machine to machine in order to coordinate with the use
        of iot we can interact, elaborate and learn from the experience just as
        humans. The machines are hence intelligent enough to make their own
        decisions with the help of available data and learning experiences that
        can modify and adapt accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hardware contains the sensors and actuators along with the device.
        The sensors can be like IR sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor
        ,water level sensor, ultrasonic sensor, heat and motion sensor,
        accelerometer GPS module and the like. Actuators are the mechanical
        moving parts of the device. It basically converts the electrical
        impulses given by the device to physical output. The examples of
        actuators are different ranges of motors used for different purposes and
        cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to understand the functionality of the hardware layer it can be
        correlated and identified with the functioning of a human body. The
        human body senses the outside environment and sends the signal to the
        brain and the brain acts accordingly by movement or actions as required.
        Similarly, in the hardware the signal generated by the sensors are sent
        to the microcontroller or the brain to initialise the actuators to
        perform the action as and when required.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Google Home and Amazon Echo are popular in iot devices and act as an
        assistant which enables Home automation. They assist in day to day
        activities by voice recognition in form of commands. You can access all
        other enabled devices through them conveniently. These home assistants
        are enabled with Artificial Intelligence, so that they can be a part of
        your family and adjust the functionality as per requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        August Doorbell Cam is another trendy topic now which can be used as a
        home security guard who sends a notification to the authorised person of
        someone arriving at the doorstep. As the name suggests, it is a doorbell
        with camera and microphone along with speakers enabling one to one
        conversation between the host and the guest. This feature is enabled
        with the help of the internet so that we can access it globally. Further
        features may be added to this device so that the permission of entry
        will be enabled and the guest can enter with a smart door lock. This
        sort of device is really useful for the old and disabled people. The
        application of these can be implemented and soon will be a part of our
        lifestyle
      </p>
      <p>
        Our summers can be cooler and winters can be warmer with very less
        effort of successfully using iot enabled thermostat which follows and
        learns your preferences and acts desirably.
      </p>
      <p>
        The efficient use of iot devices can be seen in the area of medical
        science in this era of social distancing owing to coronavirus. We can
        depend on these devices successfully for treating the patients from
        their homes under the strict supervision of a medical professional.
