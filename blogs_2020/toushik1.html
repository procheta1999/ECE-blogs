      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In 1965, Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of Intel Corporation made an
        observation and postulated that the number of transistors in a given
        chip will double in about every 18 months. In 1971 Intel 4004 was
        commercially released as the first microprocessor (4-bit) This postulate
        has been held true for the last 50 years. Hence this is called Moore’s
        law today.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Cut to August 2014, Intel released Broadwell micro-architecture with
        14nm transistors in it. This architechture did not last long but the
        Skylake architecture is the first long-lasting CPU architecture using
        the 14nm transistors. After introducing the microprocessor chips with
        14nm transistors, Intel is unable to follow Moore’s law.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Intel thus changed its direction to cope with the technology advances
        continuing their R&D towards producing smaller transistors. Intel worked
        on multi-core CPU and hyperthreading to improve the performance and used
        the 14nm technology CPU to its fullest. Finally Intel introduced the
        10nm Transistor based CPU, the Ice-Lake architecture on May 28, 2019.
        But this timespan of five years with 14nm technology did cost a
        significant price.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The masking and lithography technology used for 14nm transistor is not
        customizable so as to create the 10nm and 7nm transistor as the widths
        are more thin compared to 14nm which makes the diffraction and
        refraction of light affect negatively. Hence a new setup was to be
        prepared to make the 10nm and 7nm transistors. Beyond 7nm, the
        lithography techniques are a serious problem. Even if they are
        overcomed, comes the effects like quantum tunneling which the FinFet
        will not be able to solve.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Intel is outperformed by Global Foundries (making chips for AMD) and
        TSMC in production of the 7nm transistor based chips commercially and
        are very much sound in producing the 5nm and 3nm technology soon. While
        Intel’s 7nm transistor based chip is delayed till 2022-23, AMD succeeded
        in releasing the 7nm based Ryzen 4000 series of mobile chips powering
        Asus Zephyrus G14, Acer swift 3, etc. ARM architecture has succeeded in
        producing 10nm technology based chips with the help of Qualcomm and TSMC
        on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 and 8nm technology on Snapdragon 670.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Considering multicore and hyperthreading, AMD has outperformed Intel
        with its 6C/12T (AMD Ryzen 5 2600) CPU released in April 2018 and 8C/16T
        (AMD Ryzen 7 1700) CPU released in March 2017 giving a much higher
        performance boost when Intel still stuck with its 4C/8T CPUs. Though
        Intel produced core i9-8950u 6C/12T CPU used in the 2018 Macbook Pro, a
        considerable number of users faced thermal issue and processor
        throttling.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In 2014, Intel made an announcement to produce 10nm technology by 2016
        but unfortunately was delayed till 2019. This setback for Intel have led
        many PC gamers and OEMs to rely on AMD, who was smart enough to grab
        this opportunity.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Apple have already been producing iphones and ipad based on the ARM
        architecture and the chips fabricated by TSMC. The ipad pro with ARM
        based chip has been tested to outperform the Intel powered Macbooks on
        heavier tasks. Hence Apple has announced its shift from Intel to ARM
        based Apple chips for the Macbooks and Imacs after the 2019-20 line-up
        of macbook.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Though 21st Century has been harsh on Intel but some facts prove that
        Intel may be back with a bang. Being an Intel lover, I desire to see the
        bang soon.
