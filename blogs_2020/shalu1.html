      <p class="lead fs-6">
        I started coding in my school days but I was not much interested in it
        as a result I got poor marks in my practical and I decided to leave
        coding but the story changed when I met my cousin (who is a software
        engineer) in my vacation he thought how to enjoy coding. He influenced
        me much & I started coding once again later on I opted ECE in my college
        where we had CS as a core subject in 2nd semester. As a beginner I
        started with C & C++, now I'm learning python, tried my hand in web
        development as well, also planning for java in coming days. Believe me
        coding is the most interesting subject just we need to give some time to
        it. (specially for lazy person like me) Now Coding is in trend or demand
        it's became necessary to know coding in majority of field.

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Nowadays, there are numerous programming languages are becoming more
        general and all-purpose, but these languages have their specialties, and
        each language has its own advantages and disadvantages.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6"><b>CODING IN C: -</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The C language is a basic programming language and it is a very popular
        language, particularly used in game programming, Because C language
        includes the additional packing of the C++, every programmer uses this
        language because it makes programs faster. However, the value of this
        language gives the reusability of C++ to get the slight increase in
        performance with C language.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6"><b>CODING IN JAVA: -</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The Java language is a multi-platform language that’s particularly
        helpful in networking. Of course, mostly this language is used on the
        web with Java applets. However, this language is used to design cross
        platform programs, Since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax. For
        C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some
        advantages provided by object-oriented programming. Like reusability and
        it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. But, nowadays the
        speed of the Java language has increased and 1.5 version offers some
        good features for easy program making.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6"><b>PERL LANGUAGE: -</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Perl language is a file management language for UNIX. But it is more
        popular for its common gateway interface programming (CGI). It is a term
        for programs that web servers can perform to allow additional
        capabilities of web pages. Pearl language is a method for searching text
        and it is used for useful server functions and other databases, and it
        is very easy to pick up the fundamentals if you have any experience in
        any language. As a CGI language, web hosting services select Perl
        language over C++ language. Because, the web hosts can review Perl
        script files. Since they are text files, when C++ is compiled.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6"><b>PHP LANGUAGE: -</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The PHP language is used to design web pages and sometimes it is also
        used as scripting language. This language is designed to develop a rapid
        website, and as a result comprises features which make it easy generate
        HTTP headers and link to databases. As a scripting language, it includes
        a set of components permit the programmer to easily get up to speed.
        However, it has more sophisticated object-oriented features.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6"><b>PYTHON LANGUAGE: -</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level
        programming language. Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and
        Procedural paradigms. Python programs generally are smaller than other
        programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively
        less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable
        all the time. Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant
        companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber…
        etc.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard libraries
        which can be used for the following:
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">Machine Learning</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc.)</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">Test frameworks</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">Multimedia</p>
