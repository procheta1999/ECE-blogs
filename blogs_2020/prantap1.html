      <p class="lead fs-6">
        With the web explosion of 90s, infrastructure with server-SAN and
        storage networks was introduced, featuring independent modules that
        could be updated or changed without effecting other layers. This
        infrastructure revolutionized IT departments. But now, in the era of
        hybrid cloud, 3-tier architecture can no longer keep up with IT needs.
        Its complex, unwieldly, doesn’t provide a firm foundation for DevOps and
        can’t scale with the magnitude it used to. Hence this led to the birth
        of the Hyperconvergence Infrastructure (HCI).
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) combines common data centre
        hardware using locally attached storage resources with intelligent
        software to create flexible building blocks that replace legacy
        infrastructure consisting of separate servers, storage networks, and
        storage arrays. Benefits include lower TCO, increased performance, and
        greater productivity within IT teams.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Going a step further, the components are brought together, which appear
        as a single entity to the user through the creation of clusters of
        nodes. In a hyperconverged environment, the components cannot be
        separated. The software-defined elements are implemented virtually, with
        seamless integration into the hypervisor environment.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b>Hyperconvergence Infrastructure consists of two main components- </b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        • <b>The distributed plane </b>runs across a cluster of nodes delivering
        storage, virtualization, and networking services for guest
        applications—whether they’re VMs or container-based apps.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        • <b>The management plane</b> lets one easily administer HCI resources
        from one place and one view and eliminates the need for separate
        management solutions for servers, storage networks, storage, and
        virtualization.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Nearly all modern hyperconverged infrastructure solutions are 100%
        software-defined, with no dependency on proprietary hardware. Each HCI
        node in a cluster runs a hypervisor (Nutanix AHV, VMware ESXi , or
        Microsoft Hyper-V), and the HCI control features run as a separate
        virtual machine on every node, forming a fully distributed fabric that
        can scale resources with the addition of new nodes.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b>Benefits of Hyperconverged Infrastructure include: –</b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b>• Turnkey Infrastructure - </b>Integrated server, storage, networking
        and virtualization resources along with end-to-end systems management
        and operations management capabilities.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b>• Fast Deployment – </b>Deploy infrastructure in minutes, so IT teams
        can elevate their focus to the applications and services powering the
        business.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b>• 100% software Driven – </b>Supports a wide variety of different
        hardware platforms – including three of the four most popular server
        platforms in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b>• Superior Performance and Resilience- </b>Hyperconverged software
        running on each node distributes all operating functions across the
        cluster.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b>• Unprecedented Flexibility- </b>A single cluster can have unlimited
        nodes, with node types having differing amounts of storage, CPU and
        memory resources, so you can run multiple workloads with maximum
        efficiency.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Enterprise IT teams today are looking for ways to deliver on-premises IT
        services with the speed and operational efficiency of public cloud
        services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google
        Cloud. A comprehensive enterprise cloud platform bridges the gap between
        traditional infrastructure and public cloud services—and
        hyperconvergence is at the core of an enterprise or hybrid cloud. The
        simplicity and flexibility of hyperconverged infrastructure is also
        driving many companies to repatriate their workloads from the public
        cloud back on-premises.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Today, mission-critical applications have to deal with demanding
        workloads that fluctuate based on real-time interactions between users
        and machines. The magnitude of workloads, unimaginable in the past, are
        now getting into the forefront like Big Data, IoT, Machine Learning, and
        Artificial Intelligence. These workloads provide business advantages
        such as operational efficiencies and competitive edge by delivering
        actionable insights, but an infrastructure that has inherent scalability
        is required to handle these workloads. Hyperconvergence exactly fits
        this requirement. WAN latency, which was dreaded earlier with Tier 1
        workloads, is no more a concern, thanks to hyperconvergence.
