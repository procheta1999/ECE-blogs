        I am Sagnik Ghosh and I am pursuing B.Tech from NETAJI SUBHASH
        ENGINEERING COLLEGE. Since childhood, I have a curiosity towards
        technology and it has been developed in various fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my childhood days, I was very poor in studies and I was also not
        able to score pass marks in all subjects. At that moment, I did not have
        any goals or any type of ambition in life. My parents always used to
        tell me to study but unfortunately, all their efforts had gone in vain.
        Not only my school teacher but also my tuition teachers used to scold me
        for not studying. But at that time I was in a world of dream and I
        thought that success will come without any type of hard work and
        sincerity. For this reason, all my classmates started humiliating me.
        For this humiliation, I had started changing my attitude towards
        studies. And with the help of my close friends, I was finally pass out
        with good score.
      </p>
      <p>
        After getting a decent rank in WBJEE, I was finally admitted to Netaji
        Subhash Engineering College in Electronics and Communication
        Engineering. At that time I always used to hate coding and this is the
        only reason to select this stream. After joining in college, I noticed
        that most of my friends were running behind coding. Some were running
        behind C, some were C++, some were Java and some were behind Python.
        After seeing them getting engaged in learning I have also joined that
        queue. At that time, I have enrolled in NPTEL C programming courses to
        learn with them but unfortunately after two months it was getting a
        burden for me. My mom always advised me to grow up my technical skills
        and for that she had suggested me to gather knowledge about Machine
        Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Web Development. So, I have
        started gathering knowledge about those but web development catches my
        attention among all those domains but I did not know how to start it.

        After clearing my 1st semester exam, one day HOD sir had announced about
        some VALUE-ADDED TRAINING(VAT) session for all 1st year students. There
        are four option regarding this training- IOT and Robotics, Web
        Development, Ethical Hacking and Autocad. Finally, I have chosen my
        favourite domain that is, WEB DEVELOPMENT. So from this step onwards, my
        journey attained an upward slope. And I started learning Front End Web
        Development by HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery. But I did
        not have any proper knowledge of responsive web pages, so I started
        using media-query. I have made a restaurant website which you can check
        it via this link-
        https://sagnikghosh.000webhostapp.com/index.html/burger/.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, my department has started a technical hub named “Elektronica”
        where my department have given me an opportunity to work as a web
        developer under Procheta Bhattacharya. With the help of my seniors I
        have developed a blogging website for ECE Tech Blogs.
