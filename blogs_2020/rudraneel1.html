      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Lately, a whole bunch of tech giants including the likes of Twitter,
        Facebook and Google have come under some serious fire from different
        governments all over the globe with allegations ranging from the usual
        accusations of privacy breaches to nefarious ploys of interfering in
        elections.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In the last decade, these companies have grown exponentially to hitherto
        unimaginable magnitudes, and grow they still do, at ever faster rates,
        all while gobbling up any and all meaningful competition.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Of course, it’s an open mystery as to how these tech monoliths seemingly
        get to simultaneously be the arbiters of their own brands of free speech
        while also enjoying the benefits that come from special laws designed to
        make them impervious to lawsuits and all scrutiny that comes from
        widespread abuse of anyone and everyone that dares to speak against the
        current hot topic, for constitutional rights be damned, we are supreme.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        A recent Twitter hack exposed glaring security flaws in twitter’s
        internal system. While the perpetrators remain at large as of date, the
        echoes of the potential hazards posed by rogue entities within and
        without looms over the world.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        A recent Twitter hack exposed glaring security flaws in twitter’s
        internal system. While the perpetrators remain at large as of date, the
        echoes of the potential hazards posed by rogue entities within and
        without looms over the world.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The hack, for what is known, while absolutely massive, was awfully
        simple for it’s scale. The world is lucky that the hackers just made off
        with barely half a million in crypto - and quite possibly billions from
        the personal chats of some of the world’s richest and most powerful men
        and women, but hey, if the media wants you to believe otherwise, who are
        you, a lowly peasant to say otherwise. An alternate reality that
        could’ve quite possibly sprung out of this hack would’ve been, say, a
        total stock market crash, or better yet, nuclear Armageddon.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Imagine waking up to see the total world credit system or stock market
        in disarray because random hackers broke in and sold all sorts of
        unsavory private messages, or maybe that actually did happen, and said
        hackers are tightly holding onto stockpiles of all sorts of secret
        messages as leverage for the highest bidder, which may as well be a
        three letter agency in the US waging war on another three letter agency;
        a little sibling rivalry, if you will.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Alternatively, imagine waking up only to discover your ethereal remains
        floating above a world engulfed in hell fire all because some hackers
        thought it’d be funny to mock a certain <s>un</s>stable Korean Dictator
        from a certain equally <s>un</s>stable US President’s Twitter - crap.
        This one actually happened. Without hackers. Well, at least it’s grade A
        entertainment.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Elsewhere, in one of the unknown alleys of China, kids put together
        boots and suits for the millionaires and billionaires, who in turn
        preach to you, the lowly peasant that thou shalt buy their brand of
        over-the-top, awfully up-marked cosmetics and lifestyle goods or else
        you’re just not woke enough and probably want to kill... hold on,
        furiously shuffles deck, &lt;insert perceived minority&gt;!.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Of course, somewhere their masters in turn reenact Nazi Germany for the
        free slave labor laughs, but no one cares. For the <s>spice</s> money
        must flow.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Dare you not question your media masters, for they are your benevolent
        guardians. Fret not, for all you need to do to achieve salvation is to
        consume. Consume and forget and believe, don’t question, leave that to
        the experts, they know better anyways.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Was the world, so wide, always this wild? Difficult to answer, for one
        genuinely would find it hard to argue for, as it would be an awfully
        malevolent take and too cynical to claim that the developments that have
        allowed for millions and billions of people all over the globe to escape
        from the jaws of desolate poverty, gain access to quality education and
        then some. Yet on the contrary, in pursuit of pure materialistic
        development, the world has lost track of the fundamental values that
        made us humans, we have seemingly lost all empathy, and live apathetic
        lives where the void can only be filled through more and more
        consumption, which, in turn, is also unquestionable. Our base needs and
        desires have all but been played up and down through algorithms and such
        to ensure that when you kneel over, some faceless monolith of a
        corporation can (and <i>will</i>) tally up <i>exactly</i> what you were
        worth, and the cycle will repeat, ad infinitum.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        We buy things we don’t need with money we don’t have and let the things
        that we own end up owning us. Such is the microcosm of our very own
        dystopia lite.
