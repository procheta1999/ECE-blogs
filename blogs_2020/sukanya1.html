        Who hasn't dreamt of flying around in spaceships and living in a world
        of talking robots as a child? I clearly remember myself living in that
        reality quite often in my sleep. It was spectacular: a vision of the
        future shrouded in fantasy. Little did I know that in the few years that
        I grow up, the world would have advanced so fast that this fantasy could
        very well be brought to life. I have always credited myself for having
        an active imagination, with my mind whirring constantly with new
        thoughts, and this, paired with my fascination for technology prompted
        me to do some research on exactly what I could expect the future to look
        like. In this blog post, I will be putting forth my understanding of the
        seemingly unbelievable reality that lies not for ahead.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">
        How is technology going to change the world in the next 30 years?
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        As engineers and as simply people living in this age of instantly
        available data, we have all come across certain terms, namely:
        Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality
        (VR), Internet of Things (IoT), etc. What are these technologies and how
        will their domestic implementation change our lives? To put it simply,
        the ability of machines to remember and learn from the data that they
        collect (machine learning) will make them intelligently able enough to
        take real-life decisions (artificial intelligence) such that they can
        become a substitute for human effort. At the same time, programming
        machines such that they let us experience simulation as though it were
        real (augmented reality) paired with their ability to entirely immerse
        us in a world of digital creations (virtual reality) will change how we
        experience everything in our day-to-day lives. Finally, connecting the
        world together in the truest sense with all appliances sharing data
        (Internet of Things) will make controlling our lives much easier and it
        will also let robots navigate the world better. This is a rough summary
        of the future that lies ahead but what will it look like for real? Read
        on to find out a few ways that technology is going to startle you!
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">HUMAN-LIKE ROBOTS</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Robots have been around for quite some time but as we go deeper with our
        implementation of artificial intelligence, these will take on more and
        more human characteristics. It may be predicted that by 2030, robots
        will have developed consciousness. This means that they will be aware of
        the reality they exist in and therefore will be able to take decisions
        accordingly (a frightening possibility for me, personally).
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT HOMES</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Very soon, buildings will have built-in AI which will allow you to talk
        to your house and command it to adjust to your needs. For example, it
        would be able to dim the lights, change the temperature, etc. Going
        hand-in-hand with this will be the use of robots at home as house help
        and for companionship. (Cue: imagine a robotic dog that plays with you
        and fetches things for you!)
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">SKYSCRAPER CITIES</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        With the advent of IoT, managing spaces and communities will become
        easier. In this scenario, autonomous cities will see a rise. This paired
        with the shortage of space will see super-tall buildings being made into
        cities with integrated offices, gyms, residential areas, administrative
        bodies and a synced ecosystem. This will radically increase the usage of
        drones for delivery as now, carrying packages will require vertical
        movement.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">MATRIX-LIKE WORLD</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Soon enough, our entire experience of reality will become digital.
        Classrooms will reject textbooks and employ VR systems to help students
        visualize better. By as early as 2025, smartphones will become obsolete,
        being replaced by bracelets or spectacles that project a simulation
        which looks like a phone screen. With the help of nanotechnology, our
        brains will be able to draw data from computers to live in a world that
        is completely digitally constructed.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">HUMAN CYBORGS</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Prosthetics that give humans superpowers or skills aren't far away. The
        advancement in technology is so rapid that humans will soon become
        comfortable with technology merging with their bodies. For example,
        people can choose to have implants in their legs to make them stronger.
        We already have accounts such as these, for example, a French artist
        uses an artificial arm which has a built-in tattoo gun. Clothing and
        suits will also come around which gives us enhanced abilities, e.g.,
        Hyundai's exoskeleton which lets you lift heavy weights. Human minds
        will be enhanced with machines we are not far from being half-human,
        half-machine.
