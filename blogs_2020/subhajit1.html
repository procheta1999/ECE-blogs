        Hey, have you developed something? Have you ever thought about to deploy
        it in real time servers? Yes I know there is no place like 127.0.0.1.
        But if you have some interests about real IT resources then you must
        learn this amazing technology Cloud Computing.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b><u>How did I know about Cloud Computing?</u></b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Until I came to know about this technology for me CLOUD is just
        something that related to rain. the word "cloud" is used as a metaphor
        for "the internet". so the phrase Cloud Computing is named as such
        because the information being accessed is found remotely in the cloud or
        a virtual space.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Few days ago I met with a problem. I need a Linux machine for one of my
        project . Now I have two options either I have to install Linux in my
        system along with windows by virtualization or I have to compromise with
        my windows. But second one is not a good option right. Now trust me if
        you go with the first option and even you have a good i5 processor with
        8gb ram you would suffer from many problems and the whole process takes
        a big time.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Now If you use cloud for any Linux or windows server you can launch it
        within 5-10 minutes. Isn't it amazing?
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        he second reason that you should learn is that suppose you want to host
        your website or you need a public access to your application. For this
        you need a web server, you need a database, you need a domain and a
        public Ip. But if you go to buy this stuffs it costs a huge amount. So
        how can you host your application? the answer is via cloud. Cloud
        provides all this services for a very less price.
      </p>
      <b><u>Why Cloud Computing?</u></b>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Before going to any long definition I want to tell you some basic
        example of cloud. Suppose Flipkart has 1000 visitors on their website
        daily .Let they need 100 servers for balance the traffic .But during
        their big billion days the visitors increased to double but they have
        only 100 server so they have to manually install another 100 servers
        before big billion days .But the problem is after big billion days the
        servers are of no use. But the company has to pay for its maintenance
        .This is the biggest issue in IT industry before Cloud.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        If you use cloud you can increase/decrease your numbers of servers
        anytime and even you can set a autoscaling group. It automatically
        increase/decrease the numbers of servers based on you traffic.
      </p>
      <b><u>What is Cloud Computing?</u></b>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of computer power, database,
        storage, applications and other IT resources through a cloud service
        platform via the internet with pay as you go pricing model.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Companies that provide Cloud services like AWS,AZURE,GOOGLE
        CLOUD,ALIBABA enable users to store files and applications on remote
        servers and then access all the data via internet.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        I personally liked AWS(Amazon web services).No doubt all others are very
        good but AWS has the highest market share (31.7%) nowadays and that's
        why jeff Bezos is the richest person of the world.
      </p>
      <b><u>Cloud Service Model:</u></b>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b><u>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</u></b>
        IaaS is also known as Hardware as a Service (HaaS). It is a computing
        infrastructure managed over the internet. The main advantage of using
        IaaS is that it helps users to avoid the cost and complexity of
        purchasing and managing the physical servers.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b><u>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</u></b> PaaS cloud computing
        platform is created for the programmer to develop, test, run, and manage
        the applications.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b><u>Software as a Service (SaaS):</u></b>
        >SaaS is also known as "on-demand software". It is a software in which
        the applications are hosted by a cloud service provider. Users can
        access these applications with the help of internet connection and web
        browser.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Now from my point of view this technology has a huge demand in IT
        industry because in the upcoming days, all companies move their
        infrastructure towards Cloud. Edge Computing is the future of cloud
        computing. You take any technology nowadays all are using cloud. You can
        build IOT devices in cloud, every OTT platform are using cloud. I keep
        this blog very short & simple. If you are learning some technologies
        like DevOps you can actually do some real time practical using cloud and
        if you need any help from my side the feel free to contact with my mail
