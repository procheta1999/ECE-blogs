      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Children have a full-time occupation: playing. For them, it’s a happy talent to know how to play. As a
child, I remember, I used to play a whole lot of games, some with friends, while some alone in the
house, some of them used to be the well-known indoor and outdoor games, while ideas of some
others came out of our little imaginative minds. Among all these, a very common game that we
often used to play, and I guess you all, especially girls, can relate to it at it’s best, and have played at
least once, is the domestic home game, in which we used to act like we are in a different world, yet
living a same kind of life with our imaginary families. In this game, we used to make gestures to do
any kind of activities, be it cooking, eating, talking over the phone, clicking pictures with camera,
writing (also doing gestures on walls like writing on a board), and what not! I remember I also used
to make patterns on my wrist like a watch and act as if I’m wearing a real watch. While playing this
game I used to wonder how nice it would have been if there actually existed a way in which even
without owning any gadgets, like a cellphone, camera or wrist watch, we could just make gestures to
actually use them! This question remained in my mind and I thought more and more about what
other things could be done if actually such an incredible technology existed. I used to look at the
pictures in my books and imagine how interesting it would be if only by looking at the pictures I
could see them moving and describing the stories and give knowledge. Or how fun would it be if we
could know their name, characteristics and interests just by a glance! 

        </p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6">Well these all imaginations, thoughts and questions remained in my mind and I did not know whom
            to discuss with, who really would be knowing if anything as such practically exists or not. All my
            doubts and queries found a way and I found that there actually exists a world of technology that I
            used to imagine, when one fine day in my early days of exploring the Internet, I came across an
            interesting term, <i>“The Sixth Sense Technology”</i>. </p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6">As the name implies, the Sixth Sense Technology alludes to a sense in addition to our five traditional
            physical senses, i.e., it is about comprehending information more than our available senses. We
            communicate with the digital world around us using the enormous gadgets available to us. But we
            can’t directly interact with the digital world since our physical body is not meant for the digital
            world. The primary goal of the Sixth Sense Technology is to connect the digital and the real world
            seamlessly and to interact with the digital world in the most direct and efficient way. </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b>History of the Sixth Sense Technology </b></p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6">Idea behind this incredible technology was started in the late 1990’s by Steve Mann (who can be
            considered as the <i>“Father of the emergence of the Sixth Sense Technology”</i>) at MIT, and further
            developed after some years by Pranav Mistry, who was then a PhD student at MIT Media Lab.
            WuW(Wear your World) was the name first proposed by Pranav Mistry, Pattie Maes and Liyan
            Chang for this technology. With the goal to leverage our knowledge about everyday objects and use
            them to interact with the digital world, Pranav Mistry started an experiment, with two mouses. He
            took the 4 rollers off from them and put them in a single line. It had some strings, springs and pulleys
            and what he ultimately got was a basic gesture-interface device that actually acted like a motionsensing device. The four roller-experiment gave him the idea that he could use the same concept on
            fingers and that’s what he next moved on to. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b>What is the Sixth Sense Technology?</b></p>
        
        
        <p class="lead fs-6">Sixth sense is basically a wearable gesture interface that emphasizes the physical world around us
            with the digital information available and enables us to use our natural hand gestures to interact
            with that information. This spectacular technology is an integration of many magnificent
            technologies and is a intuition of the concept of augmented reality. It bridges the gap between the
            digital and the real world. 
        </p>
       

        <p class="lead fs-6"><b>Components required for the Sixth Sense Technology </b></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">The first archetype or model of the sixth sense technology was bigger in size-big projector mounted
            on a helmet- and was not comfortable or easy to use for regular working purposes. Therefore, later
            the scientists came out with a modified neck-worn type, pendant-like device which was much easier
            and comfortable to use. </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">The basic components required for the sixth sense technology are: </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b><i>Camera </i></b></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">This is the digital eye of the system. It captures and recognizes the hand movements and
            gestures made by the user and the scenes the user is looking at. 
            </p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b><i>Projector</i></b></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">
            The projector augments the physical object, wall or any other interface. It faces downward
            and projects the output image on the mirror so that the user can adjust the focus and
            project on the desired image; it runs on a rechargeable battery. 
            
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b><i>Mirror</i></b></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">The mirror reverts the projection coming out from the projector. Thus, the projection can be
            made on any desired object, like the wall. The mirror can be tilted manually to change the
            location of projection. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b><i> Microphone</i></b></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">This is an optional component in the sixth sense technology. It is required when we use a
            paper as an interface; the microphone when attached with paper, senses the sound signal of
            the user touching the paper; combining with the tracking information about the user’s
            fingers to a computing device, creates a touch interface. </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b><i> Mobile-computing device</i></b></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">This technology uses a mobile-computing device as a processing device in the user’s pocket.
            The camera, projector and microphone are connected to this computing device either using
            wires or wirelessly. All the features of this system run on this computing device, which is
            connected to a network or a wireless connection. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b>Advantages </b></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">1. It has been made open-source.</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">2. It is cheap to build and use.</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">3. It is a portable, handy technology.</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">4. It can be used by anyone and everyone, even by a person with zero knowledge about mouse
            and keyboard.
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">5. This technology does not make humans understand the language and knowledge of
            computers, rather it makes machines and computers to adapt to human needs.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b>Applications </b></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">The sixth sense technology implements huge no. of numerous applications that
            demonstrate its usefulness and flexibility. 
            </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">1. Using this technology, a virtual watch can be obtained just by drawing a circle on our
            wrist with our index finger which would show us the accurate time. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">2. This technology can turn a simple piece of paper into a digital display. For e.g., a
            newspaper can show the live video of a news. </p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6">3.. The technology enables users to find millions of books over the internet that
            matches with the cover of the book the user is holding; if the name of the book is
            known, the technology may also provide all reviews available on it, including the
            sound reviews, just with the physical book in hand. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">4.Using this technology, we may project a keypad on our palm and use the virtual
            keypad to make a call, without the use of an actual mobile phone. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6">5. Just by projecting at our boarding pass, we may find the direction of the flight gate
            or even check how much our flight has been delayed. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">6. The sixth sense technology implements map which enables the user display the map
            on any physical interface and find his destination; we can use our thumb and index
            fingers to navigate the map, say, to zoom in or zoom out. </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">7. To capture an image, we may just make gesture of clicking a picture with our thumb
            and index fingers, and the image gets captured, which may later be modified,
            printed, shared or even transferred to our computer. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6">8. Just by looking at a person, we may even get to see information on him/her
            displayed on the body. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6"><i>(Aren’t these unbelievable and incredible??!!) </i></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b>Current State of the Sixth Sense Technology </b></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">The idea that Steve Mann and eventually Pranav Mistry came up with was extremely unique.
            Especially Pranav Mistry took up this technology to a different level, giving rise to the foundation of
            an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world, making a profitable innovation.
            The commercial product of the technology has not been launched yet, but the prototype is already
            prepared. It’s hardware and software assembly instructions are open-source. If in the near future,
            this technology can be made available to the mass, then the world would experience a massive
            success in the field of technology, and a new generation of technology would begin! </p>
            
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b>The Future of Sixth Sense Technology</b></p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">In future, this marvelous technology may find numerous useful applications making workflow more
            intuitive. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">1. The technology may be of great help for the disabled people: 
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">•	People who cannot speak can make others understand what they want to say with their
            sign movement’s recognition converted into text. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">•	 For the blind people, the camera may act as an eye, like their fifth sense. </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">2. The future may see a great amplification in the 3D print media. </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">3. A better world will come into existence through sixth sense technology with holography. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">4.The technology is almost like setting up a digital system in our body and implementing it in
            our everyday life. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">Thus, this technology integrates information to everyday objects, which not only help us get rid of
            the digital devices, but also fills the gap between the physical and the digital worlds.</p>

        <p class="lead fs-6">And so, by exploring about the Sixth Sense technology, I found answers to all my queries and
            interests which had grown in my mind during my childhood through a mere game and I inferred that
            indeed, all the activities I imagined of doing are actually possible with the help of this mesmerizing
            technology, the <i>“Sixth Sense Technology”.</i>
