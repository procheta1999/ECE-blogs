        The demand of a video editor is increasing day by day. Video editors transforms video clips into professional looking productions, and create a good storyline with the video clips. Many of you may think that video editing is a very hard task but trust me, itâ€™s not that hard.  Today I am going to share my personal experience as a video editor along with some professional video editing softwares and my review on those softwares.
                As a video editor, firstly one should focus on two things: 
                <p class="lead fs-6">1.	Good Framework</p>
                <p class="lead fs-6">2.	Patience.</p>
                These two are the basic things that one should always keep in mind. Before editing a video, take some time and think, arrange the frames in your mind in the best possible way. Never rush while editing a video because it will destroy the framework as well as you will become frustrated if somethings went wrong. So be very careful and patient.
                </p>
                <p class="lead fs-6">One should do proper Framecuts, audio settings, synchronization, transitions and must know the use of other tools like chroma key, overlay etc. So be patient and keep learning, no need to hurry.</p>
        </div>
       
        <div class="container__text">
        <p class="lead fs-6">Now coming to the list of best professional video editing software :</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">1.<b>ADOBE PREMIERE PRO</b>:The Best Professional Video Editing Software. If you want to make your career as a professional video editor and want to join a company, Adobe Premiere Pro is a must. So if you already know Premiere Pro then congrats. But for the beginners, it will not be an easy task to use Premiere Pro. One need to do course or learn the use properly from Youtube tutorial. Self learn is a bit difficult in this case. No other software will provide you with so much tools like Premiere Pro does. But you need to know their use properly.
            Things to keep in mind as a beginner in Premiere Pro:
            
            <p class="lead fs-6">1.	High End PC with minimum requirement of 8gb RAM Processor : Intel 6th Generation or newer. Windows10(64bit). But for HD videos, 16gb RAM is needed. More upgraded pc is suggested for good performance.</p>
            <p class="lead fs-6">2.	Not an user friendly interface.  Everything in Premiere Pro is manual. So one must know properly how to use each and every tools or it will be a mess.</p>
            <p class="lead fs-6">3.	A LOT OF PATIENCE.</p> 
            There is no need to freak out by reading this, if editing is your passion then everything will be easy and interesting to you.
            </p>
      </div>
      
        <div class="container__text">
        <p class="lead fs-6">2.<b>WONDERSHARE FILMORA 9</b>:I use this software while editing my videos. It has very user friendly interface with lots of tools. The most important thing about it is that you can use this software in a low end pc. It runs properly and smoothly in computers with 4gb RAM and i3 processor with no issues. But while heavy editing or HD or 4k video editing, 8gb RAM is recommended. Or your computer will hang. Things to keep in mind while editing in filmora: 
            <p class="lead fs-6">1.	You can add as many layers as you want. But from my personal experience, if your processor or RAM is not that good, it will not work properly. So my suggestion is to have a 8gb RAM pc and i5 processor. But it runs smoothly in i3 also.</p> 
            <p class="lead fs-6">2.	Self learn is the best to master this software. I never saw any tutorial videos or course to learn editing in Filmora. So if editing is your hobby or passion, mastering filmora is not a difficult task.</p>
            </p>
      </div>
     
        <div class="container__text">
        <p class="lead fs-6">3.<b>FINAL CUT PRO</b>:Another editing software with user friendly interface. A lot of famous YouTubers like Technical Guruji, CarryMinati(in earlier days)etc use this software for editing their videos. Minimum requirements are same as Filmora. And there are many unique tools and effects in this software. So as a beginner you can also use this software.</p>
      </div>
     
        <div class="container__text">
          <p class="lead fs-6">4.<b>DAVINCI RESOLVE</b>:The most advance video editing software till date. Not at all recommended for beginners. A very confusing interface with minimum requirement of 16gb RAM and i7 processor. Ouff! I am including it in this list just because it is one of the best editing softwares till date. I never even tried this software because the interface literally scares me. </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">One can also try softwares like Hitfilm Express, VSDC, WeVideo, Nero Video etc.</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6"><b>Make editing your passion, you can create wonders. Be patient and work hard.</b></p></div>
