        “An Introduction to a revolutionary technique in the field of
        agriculture that’s going to change the idea of farming to whole new
        level…!!”
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Well “IoT” in agriculture uses robots, drones, remote sensors and
        computer imaging combined with continuously progressing machine learning
        and analytical tools for monitoring crops, surveying and mapping the
        fields and provide data to farmers for rational farm management plans to
        save both time and money.
      </p>

      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">But why “IoT” in Agriculture?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        IoT is transforming the everyday objects that surrounds us into an
        ecosystem of information that will enrich our lives. From speakers to
        parking spaces to our homes IoT is bringing a revolution everywhere.
        Smart homes and other connected products will not be aimed at home life
        only they are also going to have a major effect in the industrial growth
        too.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">1. ‘Climate’ plays a huge part:</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Climate plays a very critical role for farming. And having improper
        knowledge about climate heavily deteriorates the quantity and quality of
        the crop production. But IoT solutions enable you to know the real-time
        weather conditions. Sensors are placed inside and outside of the
        agriculture fields. They collect data from the environment which is used
        to choose the right crops which can grow and sustain in the particular
        climatic conditions. The main target of the sensors in this field is to
        eliminate the need of physical presence during disturbing climate
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">2. Smart Farming:</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Precision Agriculture/Precision Farming is one of the most famous
        applications of IoT in Agriculture. It makes the farming practice more
        precise and controlled by realizing smart farming applications such as
        livestock monitoring, vehicle tracking, field observation, and inventory
        monitoring. The goal of precision farming is to analyse the data,
        generated via sensors, to react accordingly. Precision Farming helps
        farmers to generate data with the help of sensors and analyse that
        information to take intelligent and quick decisions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">
        3. Greenhouses can also be ‘Smart’:
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        To make greenhouses smart, IoT has enabled weather stations to
        automatically adjust the climate conditions according to a particular
        set of instructions. Adoption of IoT in Greenhouses has eliminated the
        human intervention, thus making entire process cost-effective and
        increasing accuracy at the same time. For example, using solar-powered
        IoT sensors builds modern and inexpensive greenhouses. Also, Automatic
        and smart irrigation is carried out with the help of IoT.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">4. Analysing Data (Cloud Based):</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The conventional database system does not have enough storage for the
        data collected from the IoT sensors. Cloud based data storage and an
        end-to-end IoT Platform plays an important role in the smart agriculture
        system. These systems are estimated to play an important role such that
        better activities can be performed. In the IoT world, sensors are the
        primary source of collecting data on a large scale. The data is analysed
        and transformed to meaningful information using analytics tools. With
        the help of the IoT devices, you can know the real-time status of the
        crops by capturing the data from sensors.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">5. ‘Drones’ in Agriculture:</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Technological advancements have almost revolutionized the agricultural
        operations and the introduction of agricultural drones is the trending
        disruption. The Ground and Aerial drones are used for assessment of crop
        health, crop monitoring, planting, crop spraying, and field analysis.
        With proper strategy and planning based on real-time data, drone
        technology has given a high rise and makeover to the agriculture
        industry. Drones with thermal or multispectral sensors identify the
        areas that require changes in irrigation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">
        So how does “IoT” gets in Agriculture?
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6 text-muted fst-italic">
        “All These Tech Talks are Making my Brain Swell” -----By Everyone
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        There are numerous examples of leveraging IoT technologies in
        agriculture from versatile data analytics and management systems to
        futuristic robot pollinators including climate, agricultural sensors and
        smart greenhouses. For example, Agricultural sensors can help providing
        data that monitors and optimizes crops as well as adapt changing
        environmental factors. We can use INT G01 sensor to measure the apparent
        dielectric constant of the soil and Soil PH Sensor INT-PH1 is used in
        soil PH detection. Optical sensors like Vishay uses light to measure
        soil properties by being placed on conveyances or aerial platforms.
        Mechanical sensors measure soil compaction. For measuring the aerial
        condition in the area, air temperature sensors, interior temperature
        sensors, outlet duct and evaporator temperature sensors, pressure
        sensors, humidity sensors and sunload sensors can be used. Climate can
        be unpredictable, but by collecting and analysing environmental data
        throughout a cycle of time period can make the work a whole lot lesser.
        Agricultural Weather Stations are self-contained units that are placed
        at various locations throughout growing fields. These stations have a
        combination of sensors appropriate for the local crops and climate. Data
        is measured and recorded at predetermined intervals and is compiled and
        sent wirelessly to a central data logger.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">
        Now the most basic question remains is… “will IoT farming be affordable
        ??”
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        According to Second International Conference on Intelligent Computing
        and Control Systems (ICICCS) in 2018 it was stated that each year many
        crops go waste due to a lack of optimal climatic conditions to support
        crop growth. Losses to the tune of over 11 billion dollars are reported
        each year in India alone. After this “sensors” sound a bit cheaper.
        Moreover, it uses the cheapest sources of energies that are available
        currently that is Solar PV and onshore wind.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">
        All the above facts are the “pros” of IoT Farming…so what about the
        “cons”
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The smart agriculture needs availability of internet continuously. Rural
        part of most of the developing countries do not fulfil this requirement.
        Moreover, internet connection is slower. The smart farming-based
        equipment’s require farmers to understand and learn the use of
        technology. This is major challenge in adopting smart agriculture
        farming at large scale across the countries.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center fs-5 fw-bold">
        Last but Not Least…A few things to consider before your smart farming
        solution:
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">1| Hardware</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        To build an IoT solution for agriculture, you need to choose the sensors
        for your device. Your choice will depend on the types of information you
        want to collect and the purpose of your solution. In any case, the
        quality of your sensors is crucial to the success of your product, it
        will depend on the accuracy of the collected data and its consistency.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">2| The Brain</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Analysis of the data should be at the core of every smart agriculture
        solution. The collected data itself will be of little help if you cannot
        make sense of it. Thus, you need to have powerful data analytics
        capabilities and apply predictive algorithms and machine learning in
        order to obtain actionable insights based on the collected data.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">3| Maintenance</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Maintenance of your hardware is a challenge that is of primary
        importance for IoT products in agriculture, as the sensors are typically
        used in the field and can be easily damaged. Thus, you need to make sure
        your hardware is durable and easy to maintain. Otherwise, you will need
        to replace your sensors more often than you would like.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">4| Mobility</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Smart farming applications should be tailored for use in the field. A
        farm manager should be able to access the information on site or
        remotely via a smartphone or desktop computer. Plus, each connected
        device should be autonomous and have enough wireless range to
        communicate with the other devices and send data to the central server.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">5| Security</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        To ensure that your smart farming application performs well, you need a
        solid internal infrastructure. Your internal systems have to be secure.
        Failing to properly secure your system only increases the likeliness of
        someone breaking into it, stealing your data, or even taking control of
        your autonomous devices (can be drones or even tractors).
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">#Just a fact:</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        It is estimated over 30 billion devices could be connected to the
        Internet of Things by 2020. In recent times a “Robot” named “Row-Bot” is
        developed which is dedicated to increasing the efficiency of nitrogen
        fertilizer use in production agriculture.
