        Swami Vivekananda said that there is no age restriction in learning. And
        I have believed it from the bottom of my heart, since childhood. My
        journey with technology started with a failure story, surprisingly. The
        failure story was me failing to fulfil my childhood dream of being a
        doctor. After my board exams, I appeared for NEET where I failed to get
        a suitable rank to get into any reputed medical college. My parents
        didn't want me to drop a year and prepare again, so they did not allow
        it. Instead, they advised me to opt for engineering. But I never thought
        of engineering as a career option.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, yeah, at last, I opted for engineering and began my engineering
        journey in Netaji Subhash Engineering College in the department of
        Electronics and Communication Engineering in the year 2018. At first,I
        was pretty confused where to start. And then I came to know of NTPTEL
        courses,through which students can do courses for acquiring new skills
        and getting MAR and MOOCS points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the courses offered , one was Programming with Python. Now, until
        that moment, Python appeared to me as only a snake and not as name of
        programming language. So I was pretty surprised on the fact that how can
        I do programming with snakes. Funny, right ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I came to know that Python is a programming language, super
        easy to understand and implement. But, in my case, the irony was, I,
        having no prior knowledge in programming(except GW Basic) and being a
        biology student in +2 years, started with Python, where many people
        started Python after, they have done programming in C,C++,etc. I started
        Programming in Python in NPTEL, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to cope
        up with the course. But I had some of my basics cleared and also did a
        Python programming course (basic) in FutureLearn. In my second semester,
        I was introduced to IoT as a part of the training project of my college.
        Iot has been interesting to me always. So, I, who knew nothing at the
        beginning, was working to gather knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        IoT was the first domain of technology that I was interested in. And
        along with it came the world of robotics. In these field, I explored
        Arduino, its functions, applications and also diverged into the advanced
        world of IoT. But I, having no knowledge of web development and servers
        prior to this training, my friend and I used Ubisoft for the server
        purpose. But, along with the introduction of IoT, I started to gather
        interest in Web Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the semester break, I started learning Python and after that, started
        learning HTML,MySql and CGI. The first application that I built in web
        development was a simple bank application using
        HTML,Python,MySql,CGI.This is the
        <a href="https://github.com/procheta1999/xyzbank.git" target="_blank"
          >project</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my third semester, I came to know of DSC of my college and I applied
        for position in the web development team of DSC. And to my surprise and
        utter happiness, I got selected. So from this step onwards, my journey
        attained an upward slope.And I started learning frontend web development
        properly, starting with HTML,CSS,JS, Bootstrap. Still my skills required
        polishing. And I began actually polishing my skills from fourth semester
        onwards, when I got a chance to hold forums on web development forums in
        my own college. Then I started exploring web development more and more.
        On the way I learnt AMP-HTML and made some cool simple webpages on the
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before this, I didn't have proper knowledge of responsive web pages. So
        I learnt using media-query and more to make my web-pages responsive. My
        big break in web-development when DSC NSEC decided to build up a blog
        website and Anubhav Singh suggested me to work it on Next.js. So I
        started building the webpage(it is still in progress now) along with my
        some of my friends , on Next.js,Redux,Firebase,Material UI( and it was
        literally my first time using them) and I came to know and learn a lot
        of things in this process. And added to that, my department also started
        the technical community "Elektronica", where my department, recognizing
        my web development skills, gave me the responsibility of being the lead
        of the Web D domain of the tech community. And I, along with my team,
        set up the website for ECE Tech-Blogs
        <a href="index.html" target="_blank">tech-eva.live</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So this is my story. I love engineering . I am still struggle with bugs
        in my code and I think, in this way, people learn. So I am still a
        learner.
