        So, what's this all about - VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS (VPN’s) are a
        common way to connect remotely to a network in a secure fashion. A VPN
        creates a private network connection over the Internet to connect remote
        sites or users to the private network. Security is accomplished by
        encrypting all the transmissions.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        A VPN allows a remote user to have network access, just as if it was
        local to the network as if the user were local, but it also makes the
        connection secure. Since most organizations have many employees
        traveling and working from home, remote network access has become an
        important security concern. Users want access & administrators want
        security - VPN provides both. To accomplish this purpose, the VPN must
        emulate a direct network connection. This means it must provide both the
        same level of access & security as a direct connection. To emulate a
        dedicated point to point link, data is encapsulated or wrapped, with a
        header that provides routing information allowing it to transmit across
        the internet to reach its destination. This creates a virtual network
        connection between two points. The data being sent is also encrypted,
        making the virtual network - private.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        A VPN do not require a separate technology or direct cabling. It is a
        virtual private network, which means it can use existing connections to
        provide a secure connection. In most cases it is used through normal
        internet connections.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        A variety of methods are available for connecting one computer to
        another. Once upon a time, it was common to dial up to an ISP via a
        phone modem. Nowadays, cable modems, cellular devices, and other
        mechanisms are common: - not inherently secure. Any data that is sent
        back & forth is unencrypted - anyone can use a packet sniffer to
        intercept & view the data, and neither end is authenticated. This means
        we cannot be completely certain - who we are really sending data to or
        receiving from - VPN provides answers to all these issues.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The arrangement is generally acceptable for an ISP. The customers
        connecting simply want a channel to the Internet and do not need to
        connect directly or securely to a specific network. However, the setup
        is inadequate for remote users that attempt to connect to an
        organization's network.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In such cases - the private & secure connection that a VPN provides is
        critical.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Individual remote users are not only the users of VPN technology. Many
        larger organizations have offices in various locations. Achieving
        reliable and secure site to site connectivity for such organizations is
        an important issue. The various branch offices must be connected to the
        central corporate network through tunnels that transport traffic over
        the Internet.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Using VPN technology for the site to site connectivity enables a branch
        office with multiple links to move away from an expensive, dedicated
        data lines to simply utilize existing Internet connections.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        There are various ways to achieve the encryption needs of a VPN. Certain
        network protocols are frequently used for VPN 's.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The two most commonly used protocols for this purpose are -
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <b>1.POINT TO POINT TUNNELLING PROTOCOL (PPTP)</b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6"><b>2. LAYER 2 TUNNELLING PROTOCOL (L2TP) </b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        But will talk about them in detail perhaps in another blog.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
