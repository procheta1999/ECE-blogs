      <p class="lead fs-6">
        I have been using the Linux based OS for almost a year and a half now
        and here are some of my experiences that has kind of convinced me to
        stay with the Linux kernel even on a brand new laptop that had Windows
        10 Home as a pre-installed OS on it.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        GNU/Linux is a Kernel, created and maintained by Linus Benedict
        Torvalds. He first introduced Linux in 1991 and was overwhelmed on
        getting ideas and soon code contributions within a very short time which
        marked some of his early success. Today Linux runs almost all the
        servers, Android, all embedded systems and some of Home PC desktops.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Linux kernel bundled with a software repository, a desktop environment
        and some basic applications pre-installed is known as a distribution.
        There are hundreds of such distributions and more than one repositories
        to choose from. This does make linux a very customized operating system.
        After switching to linux, I gathered all these kind of information
        enough to extend my love towards this community though I have never
        contributed code. Though Ubuntu was first to introduce me to this
        community but Manjaro linux has attracted me a bit more primarily
        because of its usablity and the software management that is much more
        unified and composed than Ubuntu. Since then I have been using majaro.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        I switched to Ubuntu initially because the distribution aimed to be
        different and also simpler, minimal yet appealing desktop layout. The
        experience that Ubuntu ran much faster than before on my i3 3rd
        generation processor even on dual boot, did convince me switch to ubuntu
        completely. I faced issues as I had no idea what alternative softwares
        to use instead of the proprietary softwares that exclusively ran on
        windows. Then I came across ‘wine’ that runs windows applications on
        linux. I also learned some basic commands to work on linux command line
        utility. It took me almost four days to successfully boot up, install
        and run Ubuntu which was definitely scary but when the laptop ran faster
        than before, it felt like the pain was worth it.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Now comes the best part, the rise of the Online Classes during the
        lockdown did give my laptop a bit of setback in terms of hardware. I
        bought a new laptop, obviously with windows 10 Home pre-installed. After
        the successful boot-up, I found almost every application bundled with
        the OS was nothing but a trial version of the actual one. Being used to
        linux and open source softwares for the past year, this situation did
        knock me off enough to convince myself remove Windows and install
        Manjaro Linux that was last installed on my old laptop. Slowly I figured
        out how to maintain the hyperthreading in linux and power management
        since the laptop ran without a battery and a hyper-threading enabled
        processor. Yes, definitely I faced issues when it came to installing
        softwares (that neither ran linux through wine or any alternative was
        there for linux) for online practical classes of my College, but I
        thought it better use Windows on a virtual machine than to use it in a
        dual boot setup. This step may make me look a bit insane but I feel it
        is the beauty that linux is preaching since it’s very existence.
