      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"><b>What is branding?</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Branding can be defined as a way in which you convince the customers to
        look at your business in a certain way which is usually a lot more than
        just colourful logs and catchy taglines. Logos , colours and taglines as
        important as they are do not entirely constitute a brand. The definition
        of the brand comes with its meaning and interpretation. And words are
        the best way to express that.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">
        <b>Why can content writing be considered important in branding? </b>
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Content writing is very important when it comes to tell people what your
        brand is all about . A good , consistent and high quality content
        impacts the audience more than any other way of branding, a cohesive and
        well written content will ensure that the reader understands what you
        want to express to your customers and this will further ensure the
        success and determine the wellbeing of your business.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Nowadays advertising has shifted from old-school means to digital
        advertising over social media platforms and by recommendation of a third
        party and hence it becomes all the more important to accompany your
        brand name with a cohesive and well written content which will be able
        to resonate with the reader.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"><b>The importance of content: </b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <u><i>Elevating your brand:</i></u> as mentioned earlier , catchy
        taglines and colourful logos are not enough to make your brand resonate
        with your audience. In today's time of digital advertising a cohesive
        and well written content will help to create an impact on the audience
        and hence will also help in growth of the brand as a whole.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <u><i>Increased audience retention:</i></u> a well written content will
        always grab your audience’s attention and once that i done it will
        attract customers to your brand, content writing when done correctly and
        consistently will provide satisfactory to your audience and hence will
        make them come back again and again
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <u><i>Reinforcing brand message:</i></u> the best way to make your brand
        message clear to the audience and reinforcing it on them would be
        through a well written piece of article, once the reader reads it it
        will grab their interest and also make it easier for them to have a
        clear image of what the brand can do for them.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <u><i>Increasing your presence on social media:</i></u> most of the
        advertisement nowadays is done digitally through social media platform
        and an increased social media presence would be beneficial for the brand
        as a whole, in today's world of business an important consideration
        should be that of social media and while social media followers are an
        important aspect a beautifully written content will help you have some
        more
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <u><i>Your own voice:</i></u> the best way to express what your brand
        stands for would be through your own voice, content writing here is
        important because it lets you express what your brand stands for, what
        it strives to achieve and what it promises for the customers. Once you
        have beautifully expressed yourself in the form of a content the reader
        or the customer understands it best and hence will be attracted to your
        brand.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">
        <b>Conclusion: </b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        A well written content can be considered as a form of currency in
        today’s world . digital marketing in today's world in nothing but a
        constant stream of content and social actions and this is why blogging ,
        creating video content and influencer marketing has emerged popular
        means of marketing nowadays A consistent and cohesive piece of text
        describing our goals and aims can be considered as something we can use
        to get the audience to take an interest in. This interest can in turn be
        used to ensure a greater sale of our product. And meanwhile the more the
        content is shared the more sales it will bring. Hence content writing is
        important and is indeed a way to create a conversation between you and
