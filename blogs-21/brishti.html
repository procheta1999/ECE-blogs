        Technology as we know it has drastically altered our lives in ways that
        we would have deemed impossible just thirty years ago. It has molded our
        very existence and has played an important role in human evolution.
        Considering the amount of time we spend with our smartphones and other
        gadgets in our everyday life, we would find it hard to function or work
        properly without them even for an hour. Imagine having to drive to a new
        destination without your GPS or your online song playlists to keep you
        company. The constant dependence of humanity on technology implies how
        difficult it is to live without it. Ironically this technical revolution
        which has taken over the world like a storm is dangerously tilting the
        global ecological balance.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Over the last few years, the global tech market of electrical,
        electronic and related equipment has grown rapidly, while the lifespan
        of the hardware products has become progressively shorter. Thus both the
        business sectors and the waste management sectors are looking at a new
        and problematic challenge of constant generation of e- Waste.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        According to the statistics and the current trends, the amount of
        electronic goods will continue to increase exponentially over the coming
        years on a global scale. Microprocessors are a growing demand in this
        pandemic situation where the world is moving toward a vast network on
        the digital front.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In India, the number of digital communication devices that were sold
        exceeded 607 million in the past two years. In a nationwide survey, it
        was found that 119.2 million television sets have been bought or
        procured in the rural areas the last year. The total number of units of
        electronic and communication devices sold on the Indian market in 2020
        were worth more than 15,652 billion Indian rupees.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Consequently, the volume of e-Waste grows at a rapid pace every year and
        is also said to be one of the most critical waste disposal issues of
        this century. To be more precise and accurate the United Nation has
        estimated that 20 to 50 tons of e-Waste is being generated per year on
        an international basis. Thus there is an immediate need to develop a
        proper way of disposal of such items.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Compared to the conventional waste, certain components of electronic
        products contain extremely toxic compounds, which can generate a threat
        to the biosphere as well as to our health. For example monitor screens
        normally contain hazardous and toxic materials such as cadmium, mercury,
        and lead while beryllium, nickel and zinc can often be found in
        different circuits.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        When these parts are thrown in landfills or incinerated, they pose
        certain health risks due to the radioactive decomposition of metals they
        contain. The improper disposal of electronic goods which increase
        exponentially over the years can lead to the increase in possible damage
        of the human body resulting in elevated risks of cancer, tumours along
        with developmental and neurological disorders. W.H.O has claimed that
        constant exposure to radiation from irresponsible e-Waste landfills can
        cause joint pain and other disorders in adults and brain damage and
        anaemia in children.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In India, the e-Waste management shoulders greater impact not only due
        to the generation of our own waste but also constant dumping of e-waste
        especially old computer hardware from the developed countries.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        At present Bangalore itself generates about 10,000 tonnes of computer
        waste on an annual basis and in the absence of correct removal, they
        sell them to scrap dealers.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The current demand is to aim at reducing the accumulation of used and
        discarded electronic devices and equipment. India as a developing
        country needs simple and a low cost technology that will help in maximum
        resource recovery in eco-friendly methods.
