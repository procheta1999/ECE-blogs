      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Artificial Intelligence and Robotics together will change the entire
        world because it is one of the most powerful combinations. The things
        which we can only imagine 10 years back are now becoming reality. In
        today's world AI and ROBOTICS are serving people as a problem solver
        ,fastest responders and companions. The adaptability of ROBOTICS and AI
        has made them the best and favourable in all sectors. For every field
        that is gaming ,education, fitness ,manufacturing and defence technology
        it is used. Many online gambling sites like TRUE BLUE CASINO have stated
        to have used AI based algorithms to control the games.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        So it is really evident that the two will positively change the entire
        world in our recent futures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">
        <b>USE OF AI AND ROBOTICS AS A VIRTUAL ASSISTANCE</b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The AI system in recent days has gained a lot of its glory with the help
        of robotics. Both technologies work at its best when combined together.
        Virtual assistance and chatbox use automated rules using capabilities
        like NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NPL). The recent advancements in the
        technologies have significantly improved their performance.In recent
        times the glorified versions of the VIRTUAL ASSISTANCE are SIRI to
        GOOGLE ASSISTANCE and ALEXA. They answer almost all the questions. With
        the help of IOT we can command our VIRTUAL ASSISTANCE to turn on AC,
        Light,Fan.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"><b>ADVANCED SECURITY</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        ROBOTICS and AI strongly have the most powerful use on Security and
        Surveillance and they use artificial intelligence , high definition (HD)
        cameras , long range and fast computing processes all of which marks the
        SECURITY SYSTEM for different needs. The recent AI SYSTEM uses FACE
        RECOGNITION to store the identities of people visiting to a particular
        place and creates a catalog of visitors who visited regularly and can
        remember the faces which are known.Some robots are designed with
        advanced GPS technology. Ao that they can find any objects easily. The
        foundation of AI based security systems is a self monitoring system that
        features HD VISUALIZATION. They also use FINGERprint and EYEBALL
        scanners which are mainly used in MILITARY HEADQUARTERS and many
        confidential places. They are mainly used to avoid the interference of
        any third party.

      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">
        <b>ARIEL TECHNOLOGY AND AUTONOMOUS FLYING</b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Autonomous flying is used in drones basically and COMPUTER VISION
        TECHNOLOGY (CVT) is used while avoiding obstacles on moving on a
        straight path. They are used in the defence force in any rescue missions
        etc. The main application of computer vision in flying includes obstacle
        detection , self navigation , object tracking etc. The drones in recent
        days are used in smart cities and management for advanced surveillance,
        recognition of certain stuff and tracing unwanted objects.It uses UAVs
        to capture real time data , it also uses an onboard intelligence system
        which makes it human independent. It is also used by armies to bombard
        or combat enemies in scanning or mapping terrains and buildings during
        attacks and surgical strikes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"><b>GAMING</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        AI SYSTEM and ROBOTICS helps a lot in developing games and it is
        basically the main weapon of game developers.AI system helps the gamers
        to create a character that can imitate real human beings. Games are
        basically meant for entertainment and it also collects and processes
        data obtained from users. It helps games to create games based on their
        needs and expectations . AI based games have tremendous and stunning
        graphics .It actually needs more than a hundred developers to create a
        game but it is possible with an AI system. It saves our time and
        resources as well.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"><b>MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES </b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Nowadays AI and ROBOTICS are also serving in the manufacturing
        industries.The main reason for its working in such industries is to
        cover the lack of workforce,improve efficiency and simplify the whole
        production process . It basically uses the teams effort to manage the
        task system but nowadays it has helped manufacturer to boosts their
        production speed.The main function of ROBOTICS and AI based system in
        these industries are DEMAND BASED PRODUCTION,AUTOMATIC CONTROL,DAMAGE
        CONTROL AND QUICK MAINTENANCE,PRODUCT DESIGNING AND REDESIGNING.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        AI and ROBOTICS are the driving force of the technology of the future.AI
        is actually all about data but will use the given data for our benefits.
        By the end of the next decade ,we will surely see some stunning
        technologies based on AI and ROBOTICS.
