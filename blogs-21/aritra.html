        If you search the term ‘API’ in Google it will say that it stands for
        Application Programming Interface. Now what is this API? Let’s dive into
        it. The software development world is advancing every day. Each day a
        new programming language or a new technology pops up. There are
        developers in each part of the world and they are using different kinds
        of technologies to build an app or a software. Maybe even one software
        is being made using a different programming language. Now it is not
        possible for a developer to learn all the programming languages that
        exist. So, if two developers are working on a software in two different
        languages, connecting those two languages becomes troublesome. Here API
        comes into picture. API helps both developers to form a bridge between
        the two programming languages they are using.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Suppose you are sending a message using Whatsapp. The message is sent to
        a server which is inserting it to a database and sending back a response
        to you that the message is delivered. This bridge between your mobile
        app and the backend server is known as API. We can use an analogy to
        explain this whole system better. Suppose you are a customer who ordered
        a dish at a restaurant. The waiter takes your order and delivers it to
        the chef. The chef prepares the food and the food is delivered to you by
        the waiter. So, here you don’t go to the kitchen to collect your own
        food. The waiter acts as a bridge between you and the kitchen. Hence,
        API helps the client side and server side to be loosely coupled.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In modern day applications API or to be specific RESTful API is highly
        used. A RESTful API is an API which follows the REST (Representational
        State Transfer) architectural style. This REST API was created by the
        computer scientist Roy Fielding. In earlier days the client and server
        side were to be written in the same programming language for easier
        connection to the database. After the invention of REST API this
        changed. Now the server side can be written in any language irrespective
        of the client side. For example, a weather app consumes the weather data
        created by weather stations via REST API and spews out that data in a
        readable format to the end user. REST API made the job of developers a
        lot easier.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Now let’s dive deeper into REST. Every API cannot be a REST API. There
        must be some constraints which when met can be REST API. When a client
        makes a request via REST API, the server transfers the representation of
        the state of the resource in a readable format such as JSON, HTML etc
        via HTTP. JSON (Javascript Object Notation) is universally used as an
        API. It transfers the data in key-value pairs which helps the developers
        to understand and create the end-user application accordingly.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        <i>An API to be a REST API has to meet these criteria:</i>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">• Requests should be made through HTTP.</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        • Every request should be Stateless i.e., no client information should
        be stored to get requests and each request must be independent from each
        other.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        • Cacheable data that streamlines client-server interactions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">
        <b>CONCLUSION</b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        REST API has made software development easier than ever. It is widely
        used in Internet of Things (IoT) and Mobile App Development. In this
        pandemic situation too REST API has helped millions of users by
        conveying them with data such as the number of infected and recovered
        patients. Today anyone can build an app in a matter of a few days
        without worrying about database and server-side languages.
