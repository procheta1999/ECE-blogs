      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The term ‘Photo-biomodulation’ was first introduced in 1997. Previously
        it was known as ‘Low Level Laser Therapy’. It was first developed in
        1967 by a Hungarian doctor Endre Mester. There are two basic roots in
        which light can be used to cure disease – one is to combine the light
        with photosensitizing dyes in what we call photodynamic therapy which
        may cause harm to the cells and the other is to use the light alone,
        which is known as low level laser therapy. It tends to simulate things.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">History:</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In 1967, Endre Mester wondered if lasers can actually cause cancer
        irrespective of any situation. So, he wanted to pull out some theories.
        He took some mice, shaved their back hair and made two groups- one group
        got applied with the low powered ruby laser to one group and another was
        unchanged. Instead of getting cancer, the laser treated group got their
        hair back more quickly than the others. This is how the low laser
        therapy started.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        During the early years, this laser biomodulation process encountered
        some problems. There were some terms such as Bio stimulation, Cool
        Laser, Soft Laser or Soft Power Laser Therapy. In 2015 the term
        'Photobiomodulation’ or ‘Photobiomodulation Therapy’ was added as a new
        term to the existing record of ‘Low Level Laser Therapy’ because of the
        efforts of Dr. Praveen Arany. People tend to use low level energy
        because it works better than the high levels Which is the whole concept
        of biphasic dose response or hormesis.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Treatment:</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In general, a few joules per square centimeter of red or near infrared
        light will be enough to cure the problem but a large amount such as 5000
        joules per square will be detrimental. These good effects will go away
        and there is a chance that the detrimental effects may go away. This
        involves dissecting the molecular and cellular mechanisms in which the
        photons are absorbed by the mitochondria. They stimulate more ATP,
        produce low levels of oxygens and activate transcription factors such as
        NF kappa-b which is a very clear trophic transcription factor and cause
        the translation of many gene products that do all the beneficial things
        of low-level life so what could be produced at low levels.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        A light source is placed near the skin or touching the skin, allowing
        the photons of light to penetrate tissue where it interacts with
        chromophores of cells. It results in photochemical changes that lead to
        changes in cells and tissues of the body. The main mechanisms occur at
        mitochondria. Light induces a complex chain of reactions in damaged
        tissues which fastens the wound healing or the cell reformation. It
        helps in restoring the normal cellular function. Well, a recent paper
        says that light can enhance the performance of tissues and cells. The
        effect depends on the density of the light and for how much time it has
        been applied. Usually, the application time is between 30-60 seconds.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        It is a non-thermal process involving endogenous chromophores obtaining
        photochemical events at various biological levels. PBM devices have been
        lately cleared for marketing by FDA through the Premarket
        Notification/510(k) process as sub-essential devices for the temporary
        relief of pain.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Application:</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        This technology is used to stimulate wound healing. In basic cases or to
        be accurate minor such as aches or scrapes it can stimulate healing of
        fractured bone or tendon ruptures or cartilage. It is even used for
        serious injuries such as spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries
        or heart attacks or strokes. It produces inflammation and reduces pain.
        PBMT has assured cure from many sports injuries such as hamstring pulls,
        plantar fasciitis. The United States and many other Olympic teams have
        adopted it as essential pain management.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Contradictions:</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Though PBMT is used to relieve lots of problems but there are some
        exceptions also.
        <br />
        1. This infra-red light may cause harm if viewed from a distance less
        than 1.1 meters.
        <br />
        2. It shouldn’t be used over any known malignant reasons such as cancer
        therapy. It may cause side effects: oral mucositis, radiation
        dermatitis.
        <br />
        3. Treatment over a tattoo may cause unbearable pain because of the
        laser heat.
