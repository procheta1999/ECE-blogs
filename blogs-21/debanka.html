        This blog is a personal project of mine.I live and breathe in Computer
        Architecture, semiconductor technology, and all things related to it.
        The aim of this blog is to discuss about a mixture of topics related to
        modern day processors. My writing style will be a bit technical in
        nature some of the points will dive into specific topics that'll be more
        sophisticated for example:-Pipelining, superscalar OOOe, But I'll make
        sure to keep it short and simple for the broader audience and average
        layman.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In this particular blog I'm going to be discussing about one of my
        favorite microprocessor of all time the infamous pentium 4, 2nd only to
        power pc 620 . Infamous for the various reasons we'll be discussing in
        this blog.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The pentium 4 isn't a bleeding edge high end microprocessor by any means
        whatsoever, Infact this particular cpu is 2 decades old. Still I find
        the architecture and goals of this design extremely fascinating and how
        it changed the perception of clock speeds
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">
        <b>THE MYTH: Higher clock speed(mhz) = always better. </b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The pentium 4 hits the market around November 2000 and it was the first
        major new x86 microarchitecture from intel since pentium pro's (p6)
        core. The p6 microarchitecture was dominant at that time and it came in
        its reincarnations the pentium Il, pentium lII. If anyone was paying
        attention during that , CLOCK SPEED SELLS. Intel definitely was paying
        attention and they kept mhz at the foremost of their minds. This was
        quite evident from intels promotional event, marketing to every last
        details of the processor architecture..
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"><b>PIPELINING</b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Pipelining is extremely crucial in secreting every last drop of
        instruction level parallelism. Unfortunately due to the size of this
        blog its not feasible to discuss about Pipelining but in short it has to
        do with increasing the overall throughput of the particular machine.
        Alongside the increased throughput deep Pipelining is extremely helpful
        in making the processor reach stratospheric clock speeds. Although
        Pipelining comes with its own set of drawbacks and that is though
        increased latency and complexity. Because of these drawbacks, many
        critics of the pentium 4 microarchitecture, dubbed as "Netburst" by
        intel, have suggested that the staggering long 31 stages of pipeline was
        In Fact a gimmick-- a poor design choice made for the reasons of
        marketing and not performance. Intel knew that the general public
        associated higher clock speeds with higher performance, so they designed
        the cpu to run at enormous clock speeds that would prove detrimental to
        real world performance, power consumption and scalability. As it turns
        out pentium 4 critics were both right and wrong in spite of the
        predictions and assumptions that might sound absurd. The pentium 4's
        performance scaled fairly well with clock speeds, but they were right
        about the design philosophy and the origin of the pentium 4s deep
        pipelined design. In my understanding and it's pretty safe to say that's
        the actual case, even though intel will probably never publicly
        acknowledge that. The pentium 4s design team was instructed by the
        market ing team to design something that would reach stratospheric clock
        speeds which will Give intel a massive mhz lead over its rivals. When it
        comes to clock speeds higher is often better, but due to the industry
        wide problems of transitioning to the 90nm in general, proved to be
        problematic for the pentium 4 which relied on its higher clock speeds to
        achieve performance and maintain an edge over its rivals Another point
        to note here is that power Consumption doesn't linearly scale with clock
        speed. For example a 20% clock speed increase would require 50% extra
        power consumption thus the pentium 4 required a lot of additional power
        than the competition to maintain its trivial lead.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">
        <b>CONCLUSION</b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Regardless of the drawbacks, pentium 4 proved to be a successful product
        both in terms of performance and commercially, despite the public
        reception. The initial releases were problematic because of their
        inability to clock higher which stems from the inferior 130nm node. The
        further releases down the line were remarkable.This is due to the way
        pentiums advantage in certain types of applications specifically 3d and
        streaming media applications. Thus I feel like this particular
        architecture is fascinating in its own rights.
