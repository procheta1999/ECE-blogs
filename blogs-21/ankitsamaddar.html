        Every day is a technological marvel. We can drive, bank, travel, connect with friends and family, even run our home from wherever we are. However, all that convenience has a dark side. Every different connection creates another opportunity for a hacker to get in. Every year there are billions and billions of dollars of loss from cybercrime. Some have been hacked and know it, and some who do not know it yet. We will get hacked, and we should understand how to react to it.
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">The First Cyber-Crime</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">The internet was born in the late 1960s as ARPANET, a small network of government computers sharing opposite sides. By the early 1980s, people all over America were dialing into the internet from their schools, homes, and workplaces, and it was just a few short years before it was hacked.
        </p>
                
        <p class="lead fs-6">In 1988, college student Robert Morris admitted that he created “Morris Worm” to penetrate research computers nationwide. His coding error allowed the worm to replicate itself, which caused computers globally to be unusable, costing $98 million to clean up. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">The New Frontier</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">Hackers’ ability to penetrate systems, and banks, and the government quickly caught the interest of criminals who saw a new frontier. When the internet started becoming a business place, to buy things and maybe visit the bank, crime became a thing. While robbing a bank exposes physical danger and risks of life. Stealing money online carried almost no risk whatsoever. With the added bonus that instead of robbing one bank branch, one could rob the entire bank at once, cybercrime escalated quickly. In 2014, cybercrime cost the global economy $450 billion; that number skyrocketed to $3 trillion just one year later.</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">Every connection in the network, be it a logical, social, or physical connection, creates another opportunity for a hacker to get in. This is the essence of modern cybercrime.</p>
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Ransomware</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">Today’s cybercriminals have moved beyond simply stealing money or data. We have seen a significant increase in ransomware attacks. Hackers essentially take the data on a computer, locking up that data by encrypting it and requiring the user to pay a ransom. </p>
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Internet Of Things (IoT)</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">We live in a world that grows more connected every day, it’s called the Internet of Things, and it’s not just the smartphone. Today, everything from the car, to door locks, to the refrigerator can go online. In 2015, about 15 billion devices were connected worldwide; that’s two devices for every person on the planet. The number of devices is projected to grow from 15 to 80 billion in the next ten years.</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">556 million people already fall victim to cybercrime each year. By 2022, there will be 50 times more information stored online, 50 times more opportunities for cybercriminals. We should be aware that we’re constantly being targeted. And these hackers are brilliant, and they’re smart; they come up with innovative new ideas. </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">The question is, where do cybercriminals get the tools of their nefarious trade? And how is a hidden online marketplace fuelling the explosive rise in cybercrime?</p>
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Dark Web</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">When we think of the internet, it’s in three layers, the clear web, the deep web, and the dark web. The Clear web is anything that you can find on search engines. The deep web is anything behind a username and password. The dark web is a separate area where specialized software is needed to access it and start viewing its websites. Drugs, guns, passwords, credit card numbers, and even humans are all for sale. Everything on the dark web is sold in Bitcoins as it secures the transaction and allows it to be anonymized. Hence, the dark web allows the buyer and also the seller to remain anonymous. </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">Cybercriminals shop for sophisticated hacks and scams on the underground markets of the dark web. These markets exist, and they are thriving; a couple of them have been taken down by law enforcement, which is excellent, but there are dozens of others. Worldwide cybercrime costs are expected to reach $6 trillion by 2021. </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">Keeping in mind that the attackers are very agile, they’re very fast, and we have to be just as fast, if not faster, to stop these things.</p>
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">What Can You Do To Be Safe?</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">
            Everybody has a role to play in cybersecurity. So some things that can be done ought to be done by everybody,
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Update all of your software. If your computer’s alerting that you’re out of date, get it up to date.</li>
                <li>Change passwords regularly. Use somewhat complicated passwords that are not easy to guess. </li>
                <li>Though not even enough, you have to make sure your antivirus software is working correctly. Keep your security software, and run security software updates.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6"> 
            Basic hygienes gonna prevent 90% of the threats from coming your way.
            <br><br>
            But for the 10% of threats you can’t prevent with basic cyber hygiene, you must use active measures to protect your data; 
            <ul>
                <li>It begins by not clicking on suspect links. Those links can embed malware into your system. They can go undetected unless you’ve got the right tools unless you are diligent.</li>
                <li>It’s also essential to monitor your devices and financial accounts for irregularities. </li>
                <li> You need to be aware of any changes in activity in your system. If your computer is slowing down or if the screen is going black and acting weird, you need to check it out.</li>
                <li> Passwords can be strengthened with two-factor authentication. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">
            Sometimes people think that cybersecurity is very complicated. Still, it’s a fundamental issue of locking your front door, closing your windows.
