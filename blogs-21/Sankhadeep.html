        Everyone is familiar with 2D printing and some of you would also know about 3D printing,but if I say that Medical science has evolved to such an extent that now it can “Print Life”, basically cell-laden bioinks are manipulated to fabricate living structures. I know it is hard to believe! Nowadays Scientists, Engineers and Doctors are working under the same roof on a new technology called Bioprinting.
    </p>
    <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">What is Bioprinting?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">Bioprinting, like 3D printing, is an additive manufacturing technology that employs a 3D digital model as a blueprint to create organs and tissues layer by layer. But in Bio-Printers cells and biomaterials(also known as 'Bioinks') are used instead of plastic and wax for creating organ-like structures that let living cells multiply and mimic the behavior of natural living systems. </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">How does Bioprinting work?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Bioprinting is done in following steps :<br><br>
        <b><u>1. Pre-bioprinting:</u></b> This step involves creating the 3D digital model that the printer will produce. Firstly, a CT scan and MRI are used to get the 3D image of the organ, then a blueprint is generated from those images using AutoCAD software. Researchers then prepare cells and mix them with their bioink(a combination of living cells and a compatible biopolymers, like collagen, gelatin, hyaluronan, alginate or nanocellulose.), using a live-cell imaging system to ensure there are enough cells and bioink to print a tissue model successfully.
        <br><br>
        <b><u>2. Bioprinting: </u></b> Bioprinters are loaded with cell-laden bioink into a cartridge and equipped with one or multiple printheads, depending upon the structure of the organ to be printed. Different types of cells, bioinks, and equipment are required for printing different forms of tissue and organs.The printing process involves deposition of  bioink layer-by-layer, where each layer has a thickness of 0.5 mm or less. The delivery of smaller or larger deposits depends on the number of nozzles and the kind of tissue being printed. The mixture comes out of the nozzle as a highly viscous fluid.
        <br><br>
        <b><u>3. Post-bioprinting:</u></b> As deposition takes place, the layer starts as a viscous liquid and solidifies to hold its shape. The final printed structures are crosslinked to ensure that they are completely stable. Crosslinking is the process of blending and solidification. Crosslinking is basically done by treating the construct with either chemicals( ionic solution) or UV light or heat. The cell-filled constructs are then grown in an incubator.

      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Why Bioprinting ?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        There has always been a lack in the number of organ donors and over the past few years there have been reports where people experience chronic problems due to the long-term damaging effects of post-transplant immunosuppression. Thus there’s a large and growing demand for an alternative to this traditional organ transplant process. Many of today’s studies on medical science,drug testing and clinical trials rely on living subjects, which is an inconvenient and expensive method for both academic and commercial organizations.


      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Future applications:

        </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">Bioprinting is still an underdeveloped technology. As researchers continue to make breakthroughs, bioprinting has the potential to have a significant impact on a wide range of application areas.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Drug development: </b>Bio-printed tissues can be used instead of a living subject during the early stages, providing a more ethical and cost-effective solution. Using bioprinting tissue can help researchers determine side effects of drugs and allows recommended drugs to be administered to humans with validated safe dosages. This not only reduces the cost but also boosts up the entire process of testing for the pharmaceutical developers with a better biological relevance to humans than animal testing.
</li>
            <li><b>Artificial organs: </b>Artificial organs are one of the greatest drivers of technology. Being able to bioprint an organ can reduce the chances of death for a person suffering from organ failure. Also artificially printed organs would not create any immune response against the body as they would be made from your own cells.
</li>
            <li><b>Cosmetic surgery: </b>Cosmetic surgeons can use bio-printed tissues for plastic surgeries and skin grafting. Researchers may now work with fake skin cells, neurons, hepatocytes, and other tissues using tissue-specific bioinks. One day, clinicians may be able to use these models for therapeutic procedures such as skin grafts, combat wound bone bandages and even plastic surgery.
</li>
        </ul>
