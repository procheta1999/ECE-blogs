        The unfortunate events of 2020 such as the pandemic popularized the
        “work from home “culture. This led to the acceleration and adoption of
        the cloud-based business models. The cloud along with containerization
        technology offers highly scalable, user-friendly services which have
        greatly aided to the “work from home “culture. With the rapid increase
        in the use of such services in recent times, the security now demands
        immediate importance. This is where DevSecOps comes into play.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 w-bold"><b>What is DevSecOps? </b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        DevSecOps stands for development, security and operations. It's
        basically a framework to integrate the security factor in every phase of
        a software development cycle and its operations. Instead of functioning
        as a protective wall around the software or applications by the use of
        DevSecOps framework developers will be able to incorporate improved
        security measures in the development phases. DevSecOps provides the
        speed and agility of a DevOps framework along with improved security.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 w-bold">
        <b>Why is a DevSecOps framework necessary? </b>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In the modern-day working procedures, everyone has a role in keeping the
        data safe. This includes even the third-party members. The present state
        of the industries demand for a transparent and accountable working
        culture. DevSecOps helps to provide this by accumulating the necessary
        people, tools and processes to incorporate improved security measures.
        DevSecOps teams tend to make better decisions related to the projects
        due to the integration of security. Thus, this will reduce the need for
        large scale fixes down the road of development and operations. A
        DevSecOps team ensures protection of newly introduced features and
        components.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In case of cloud deployments, the use of open-source software is
        increasing day by day. As a result, one needs to be very mindful while
        using such services as the open-source software are being constantly
        improved and are prone to hidden dangers. It is quite possible to
        mistake malwares for the original package files. This may lead to data
        breaches. DevSecOps helps the teams to leverage open-source packages
        while removing and identifying the malicious components. That’s why
        DevSecOps is so very important while working in the cloud.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In recent times, cybersecurity breaches tend to plague the reputation of
        companies in almost every field. By using a DevSecOps framework,
        modified security ensures protection at every level in the development
        and operations cycle.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 w-bold">
        <b
          >In a nutshell the advantages of a DevSecOps network are as follows
          -</b
        >
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        • Automation of various tasks and monitoring for potential security
        threats throughout the development cycle.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        • Customization of security parameters to detect the levels of the
        potential security breaches and data leakage.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">• Coordinated task management.</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        • Reporting and remediation of potential security threats upon
        detection.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Considering all these advantages it is important to shift from the
        traditional DevOps to DevSecOps.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead fs-4 w-bold"><b>DevSecOps V/S DevOps </b></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        DevOps has considerably improved the software development process by
        automating tasks and boosting teamwork between the developers and
        operations team.However in DevOps security needs are often left out.This
        may lead to potential data breaches and data leakage. In case of
        DevSecOps security is incorporated in every phase while ensuring high
        standard performance. DevSecOps balances the equation and reduces the
        security constraints. It integrates security in the build, test, support
        and maintenance phases. This guarantees timely migration of fully
        secured data packages over the cloud. DevSecOps provides protection
        against cybersecurity breaches. DevSecOps is just a notch higher than
        DevOps.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        With the inclination towards cloud-based services in order to boost a
        remote workforce the need for security in the predominant DevOps culture
        cannot be overlooked. So, it's about time that we adopt the DevSecOps
        framework.
