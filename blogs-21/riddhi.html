        Nanomedicine is that branch of science which fuses the definitions of biology and the concepts of technology for the prevention and treatment of diseases. It ranges from the use of nano electronic biosensors to nanoscale materials like biocompatible nanoparticles and nanorobots, for diagnosis, sensing and actuation and delivery purposes in a living organism.
        <br>
        One such nanorobot is the “Microbivore”.	
    
    </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Before diving deep into the subject let us familiarize ourselves with the question: What is Microbivore?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Microbivore is an oblate shaped spheroidal artificial microscopic nanorobotic device measuring about 3.4 microns in diameter along its major axis and 2.0 microns in diameter along its minor axis consisting of 610 billion accurately arranged structural atoms plus nearly 150 billion mostly gas or water molecules when fully loaded. It is the artificial white blood cell which floats along with the blood stream. It’s prime function is to destroy microbiological blood borne pathogens (i.e. disease causing organisms) using the “digest and discharge” protocol (i.e. internalization and digestion process practiced by phagocytes). 
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        During the early years, this laser biomodulation process encountered
        some problems. There were some terms such as Bio stimulation, Cool
        Laser, Soft Laser or Soft Power Laser Therapy. In 2015 the term
        'Photobiomodulation’ or ‘Photobiomodulation Therapy’ was added as a new
        term to the existing record of ‘Low Level Laser Therapy’ because of the
        efforts of Dr. Praveen Arany. People tend to use low level energy
        because it works better than the high levels Which is the whole concept
        of biphasic dose response or hormesis.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Now the question that must be striking your mind is how it works?
    </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The microbivore consumes up to 100-200 pW of continuous power while operating and has the ability to completely digest trapped microbes at a maximum productivity of 2 microns per 30 second cycle large enough to digest a single microbe from any major bacteremic species in a single gulp. It’s size also adds up to its advantage thereby enabling it to pass through the finest blood capillaries in the human body. The four fundamental components of the microbivore’s digestive system are as follows:
        <br>
        i)  An arrangement of reversible binding sites to initially bind and transferred into the 2 micron digestion chamber where an array of enzymes are injected<br>
        (ii) trap the microbe and once trapped the microbe is engaged in an array of grapples to manipulate and then<br>
        (iii) a morcellation chamber in which the microbe is grinded into small easily digestible particles and then at last it is sent to the<br>
        (iv)Digestion chamber where the small pieces are chemically digested. 

    
    
    </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        While operating, during each cycle the target pathogen (bacterium) gets trapped to the surface of the microbivore via species-specific reversible binding sites. Telescoping robotic grapples emerge from the silos in the device surface aiding in proper anchorage to the microbe’s plasma membrane and then transport the pathogen to the ingestion port where the pathogen is internalized into  2 micron morcellation chamber After sufficient mechanical grinding the morcellated remains are extracted six times thereby reducing the morcellate into harmless mono-residue amino acids, mononucleotides, glycerol, free fatty acids and simple sugars thus completing the digestion process of the “digest and discharge” protocol.
        <br>
        These simple molecules are then discharged harmlessly into the bloodstream through the exhaust port at the rear end of the device, thereby completing the discharge process of the protocol. 
   
    </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        But the work of the microbivore would have not been so easy without the cooperation of a variety of external and internal sensors. Internal sensors include temperature and chemical sensors such as glucose sensor, oxygen sensor, CO2 sensors which help in targeting the pathogen. Acoustic communication sensors mounted on the nanorobot hull permit the microbivore to receive computerized signals from the physician during the course of in-vivo activities. 
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">But why to use microbivores when our body itself can produce phagocytes?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        This is because:
        (i) Microbivores function 1000 times faster in comparison to natural phagocytes and antibiotic-assisted phagocytic treatments.<br>
        (ii) Microbivores are 80 times more efficient than macrophages.<br>
        (iii) Macrophages release biologically active compounds such as muramyl peptides into the blood stream whereas microbivores release only biologically inactive effluents. <br>
        (iv) Microbivores are used to deliver the drug into the body along with the function of digesting pathogens.<br>
        (v) The microbivores reach the target area and successfully transfer the drug molecule without affecting any other parts of the body.

      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Future Scopes:
        </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In the future, Microbivores can be used for the treatment of infections in the meninges and the cerebrospinal fluid. It can also be useful in curing respiratory ailments. These nanorobots could help the body in getting rid of viremia, fungemia and parasitemia besides bacteremia. 
        <br>
        Outside the body they can help in cleaning up toxic biochemicals, biohazards. They can even help in bioremediation by cleaning up other environmental organic materials spills.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Conclusion:</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Thus, in a glimpse, the existing natural treatments of pathogenic attacks can only end up in temporary pathogenic arrests or incomplete eradication. But these nanorobots could provide safe, fast, complete and an efficient eradication of blood borne pathogens using relatively low doses of devices without leaving behind any biological remnants unlike the natural macrophages and phagocytes thereby being an addition to the physicians armamentarium.
