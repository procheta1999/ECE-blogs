      <p class="lead fs-6">
        You often see, in many web pages, there is a spinner or loading option
        or indicator that tells you that a page is getting loaded and you wait
        for it to get loaded properly.I am not talking of the loader that
        appears in the tabs area; but of the loader that comes in the middle of
        the page. If you can’t recall one, check this
        <a href="https://frosty-mcnulty-66df76.netlify.app/" class="link-light">
          website</a
        >

        that I have made recently (open it in your PC for viewing it properly).
        While the website was opening, did you notice a blue spinner going round
        and round, in the middle of the page ? Yes, that was the thing I was
        talking about. The spinner vanishes and it comes to the real page.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        So the question comes: how and why to implement it ? Looking from the
        perspective of a developer, you may not find anything wrong if you don’t
        implement it, but just that it improves user experience and improves
        page loading time. And after all, you made your website for users, right
        ? Often a time, your React app might get a huge data load coming from
        the backend, just when the component will be unmounting, and you have
        written the router configuration like this (considering this.state.data
        contains the data array and ShowData component is the target component
        of the mainpage):
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        &lt;Switch&gt;<br />
        &lt;Route exact path=’/’ component={ShowData}/&gt;<br />
        &lt;Route path=’/…..’ component={....}/> <br />
        . <br />
        . <br />
        &lt;/Switch&gt;
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Provided that you have imported all the components and necessary
        features. Your app will load, of course, if there is no error, but it
        will take time. No loading,indication will come. Just a blank screen
        will appear and your user might think that the page has crashed or there
        is some problem with the website.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        So, according to me, to show the user the loading indication, you can
        approach the problem in two ways: <br /><br />

        1) You can set up conditional rendering in your main component like
        (considering this.state.data contains the data array and ShowData
        component is the target component of the mainpage) :
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        {this.state.data.length===0 ? (&lt;iv&gt;Loading&lt;/div&gt;):(
        &lt;ShowData/&gt;)}
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        And then you can customise the icon or put styles, whatever you want.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        2) You can write your router configuration in this
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        manner: const show= React.lazy(()=>import(‘......’));
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        where in import, you will mention the file path where the ShowData
        component is. Then within the ‘return’ :
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        &lt;Switch&gt;<br />
        &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Loading &lt;/div&gt;}&gt;<br />
        &lt;Route exact path=’/’ component={ShowData}/> <br />
        &lt;/Suspense&gt;<br />
        &lt;/Switch&gt;
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        And you just have to add this line in the import section at the top:
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        import { Suspense } from 'react'; <br />
        And subtract one line: <br />
        the line where you had imported the ShowData component directly from its
        source file (other than the Lazy load)
        <br />
        And you are good to go !
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6"></p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        I personally prefer the second technique, because if there is a scenario
        of having two many pages on my website, where a huge data load might be
        loaded, then I just have to specify my router configuration like
        this(not exactly like this, but similar to this), instead of making
        changes in the component files.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Lazy and Suspense, according to me, are two underrated heroes of the Dev
        world.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        So in the content above, I have already given you some idea regarding
        why to use it and how to use it. Now let’s dig deeper. So, basically,
        what we are trying to achieve here, has got a significant term in the
        developer world: ‘code-splitting’ . Now what is code-splitting? As the
        name suggests, you are ‘splitting the code’, i.e. splitting your
        ‘bundle’ size. Now, what is a bundle? Bundle is nothing but the files
        associated with your React app; in terms, the code. So when your
        application becomes big with the load of data from backend and many
        files or code, etc, then it is recommended that you ‘split the code’ and
        render your things dynamically, i.e. not all at once. You just render
        the things that are needed at that point of time. And this
        ‘code-splitting’ you can do in a React app with Lazy and Suspense.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        As the name suggests, Lazy helps you render your component dynamically
        and yeah, it’s ‘lazy’ to render your other components then, which are
        not needed at that moment. So, after all, sometimes, being ‘lazy’ is
        good but that is true in the Dev world only !
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        And as the name suggests indirectly, Suspense gives support to your page
        when Lazy has not loaded the page/ component yet. It creates a
        ‘suspense’: ‘suspense’ that a page is getting loaded.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        So many things being said, it’s now your time to explore Lazy and
        Suspense. So go and try in your code! But one thing more: I have shown
        only one lazy loading but you can lazy load as many components as you
        want, in a single React application and no need to write Suspense every
        time then ! Just put all your Lazy loading components within one
        Suspense.
