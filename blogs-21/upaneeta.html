        The ‘QWERTY’ layout Keyboard was actually designed to slow down the speed of the typists!
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">
        The QWERTY layout was invented by Christopher Sholes in 1872 for his new typewriter (there were no computers in those days). If the keys were placed in alphabetical order, people would have typed so fast that the keys would have  jammed. So, Sholes decided to mess up the keys and formed the QWERTY layout to slow down the typists.  Afterwards, the computers took the place of typewriters, but the QWERTY was already a legacy that was uncritically adopted.
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Every iPhone advertisement has its time set to 9:41.</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">Every advertisement for an Apple iPhone, the time is set to 9:41. The reason behind this is that Steve Jobs announced the very first iPhone in 2007 at this time.</p>
        </p>
        

        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">
             TYPEWRITER ! 

        </p>
        
        <p class="lead fs-6">Another QWERTY Keyboard fun fact is that ‘Typewriter’ is the longest word one can type on this keyboard, using only one of the rows on the keyboard.

        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">We are always living in the past.
        </p>

        <p class="lead fs-6">
        Everything we are experiencing right at the moment actually happened eighty milliseconds ago.<br>
        Our consciousness actually lags eighty milliseconds behind actual events, according to a certain study.

        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Why is the color of facebook blue?
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">        
        The reason Facebook is blue is because Mark Zuckerberg is a red/green color blind which means the color he can see the best is blue.
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">One can code programs by just whitespaces</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">
        There is a programming language called ‘Whitespace’ that makes it possible to code using only whitespaces. All it takes to write a program in whitespace is to use the spaces, tabs, and linefeeds. The interpreter of this language ignores any non-whitespace characters. Isn't it cool?
        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">The Wooden Mouse!</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">Doug Engelbart invented the first-ever computer mouse in 1964 and it was not made up of plastic.It was wooden back then.
        <br>It was rectangular in shape and featured a little button on the top right.
        <br>
        He named it a mouse because the cord coming out of the back reminded him of the small rodents.

        </p>
        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">3D printing is not at all a new concept</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">
The technology for 3D printing has been around for decades, but it has only started to attract attention in the past few years. The concept initially appeared during the 1980s. It was referred to as Rapid Prototyping earlier. Charles Hull secured a patent for the stereolithography apparatus in 1986, and yet, the first commercially available 3D printer was not offered for sale until 2009.

        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">The first alarm clock could only ring at one time

</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">The first mechanical alarm clock could only ring at a single time. It was invented by Levi Hutchins in 1787. It could only ring at 4 a.m back then.
It was not until 1876 that a wind-up alarm clock was made that could be set for any time.

        <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"> Sketch of the robot! 
</p>
        <p class="lead fs-6">Leonardo da Vinci sketched plans for a robot around the year 1500.Surprising! right?
