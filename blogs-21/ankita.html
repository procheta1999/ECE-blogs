         Competitive Programming is a necessity nowadays to get placement in any of the multinational companies. If you are opting for a product based company then it is a must thing to know but even if you are opting for a service based company then also competitive programming is one of the essential things to know along with aptitude and various kinds of development related projects.

    </p>
    <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">How to start with competitive programming?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">Competitive programming is basically a mind sport where people want to showcase their skills of problem solving through different mediums. But the main problem is that most of the people don’t know where to start. Many people think that you need to know a lot of different kinds of programming languages to start competitive coding. Well, to start you only need to know the basics of at least one programming language and the rest you will learn further while solving the problems by yourself.
        </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
         I think C/C++ is the most suitable language to start with competitive programming or else you can also go for JAVA as these languages are relatively faster than the programming languages like python.

      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        As of my personal experience, HackerRank is one of the best platforms to begin with competitive coding. One of the very interesting features that HackerRank provides is that if you are stuck on any problem for a very long time and you see that only some of the test cases you are passing then it gives you an option of downloading the test cases so that you can review your logic and modify it as per needed. We'll always see the test cases are also not that good as you should also try to think as of your own to increase your thinking ability. After practicing here for some 5-6 months, then you can go for contests in various coding platforms like CodeChef, CodeForces etc.

      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Benefits of Competitive Programming

        </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
              Well, there are lots of benefits of competitive coding which will help you in your later professional life as well as personal life. Some of them are listed below-

        <ul>
            <li><b>Desirable Candidate for major Companies:  </b>Well, if you are good at competitive programming that automatically keeps you a step ahead than others. The major companies in the IT sphere nowadays check a candidate’s ability in competitive programming and how he/she can solve a problem in the least amount of time.

</li>
            <li><b>Increase your Patience Level: </b>The most important thing you will learn is patience. Sometimes some problems can really get into your nerves and can make you impatient. Many people leave competitive coding  just so that they can’t keep patience. While solving problems it may happen that sometimes all the test cases are not passing and you are trying for a very long time but still that green check is not coming, so then don’t get restless or impatient, try to keep patience and figure out other possibilities to solve the problem.
</li>
            <li><b>Makes you more Faster and Focused:  </b>While taking part in various competitive coding contests will make you a more focused and disciplined coder. As in the contest you will be having a time limit so that will make you solve the problems as fast as you can with the perfect accuracy. These skills are not just beneficial for coding but also will be beneficial for any job.

</li>
        </ul>
