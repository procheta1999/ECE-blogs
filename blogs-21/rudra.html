        So imagine this - you’re fresh in the tech market looking for the latest
        and greatest card you can buy. The kind of stuff that will let you
        <em>420 blaze it</em>, as the kids say, in all the latest, glorious AAA
        titles.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Then you come across the inevitable world salad of GPU marketing
        buzzwords - RT cores, Shaders, Rasterisation performance, VRAM, GDDR5,
        GDDR6, Overclocking, etc. - you get the idea. For the uninitiated, this
        is a massive put-off; and the marketers don’t exactly have the best
        intentions as much as they have their inclinations set on making a quick
        buck off of an unsuspecting customer like you. But fret not - for this
        little blog here is just for people like you!
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Before we get started, let’s do a little housekeeping. Back in the day,
        games were really not meant to be played like they are, they barely had
        any graphics and usually game systems like the old nintendos or the
        ataris were made using some rather old microprocessors with limited
        graphics and sounds - for that generation, however, it was the greatest
        thing ever.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Fast forward a few decades and now you have games that look and play
        like the real world - er, maybe minus all the absolute chaos that you
        can cause but that’s getting way too IRL for me IRL. Digressions aside,
        games and entertainment have become exponentially more taxing which has
        lead to the current market of GPUs with insane performances and inbuilt
        memories which a decade or so back seemed outrageous to say the least.
        Even the cheap, mass market consoles pack more punch these days than
        supercomputers of the old days.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In particular, modern GPUs [Graphical Processing Units] are essentially
        mini computers within your own computer which are responsible almost
        entirely for the calculations and processing that lets you see stuff on
        your monitor. It has its own cache, its own memory, and it’s own
        dedicated output. In layman terms, for the most part, the faster and
        more powerful a GPU, the quicker it can render out frames onto your
        computer screen, and this is what you call FPS, or Frames Per Second.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Now with some of the basics cleared out, let us slide right into the
        meat and potatoes of our little discussion as we start with good ‘ole
        Rasterisation.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">What exactly is “Rasterisation”?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Rasterisation, unlike what you may think, is a fairly new method for
        rendering 3D scenes that essentially uses polygons to approximate real
        3D shapes and lighting. This is quite apparent when you use things like
        anti-aliasing or anisotropic filtering - what you’re essentially doing
        is that you’re increasing the number of polygons or using software
        techniques to make it appear as if you were increasing the number of
        polygons. This results in a sharper and cleaner 3D render. In the case
        of video games or even 3D movies, this is much cheaper to accomplish and
        easier to implement with existing game engines and 3D visual tools such
        as Unreal engine or Blender.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Modern GPUs, even cheaper, budget oriented ones are really good at this
        particular method of rendering 3D frames. Chances are, if you’re playing
        just about any game and using any GPU that isn’t an Nvidia RTX (with RT
        enabled) or AMD’s Navi lineup (Radeon 6000 Series / Superresolution),
        you’re using some form of Rasterisation for all of what your monitor is
        displaying.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">
        So with that done, what about Ray Tracing? What’s the big deal and why
        is it taking the market by such a storm?
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Well, technically speaking, the actual computational technique for RT is
        quite simple really; Imagine how human beings “see” things - millions,
        if not billions of individual rays of light(photon streams) bounce off
        of real world objects and then our brain fills in the gaps by figuring
        out the details of the raw information it receives and viola! You get to
        see the world in all of it’s splendor.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Ray Tracing or RT, employs a very similar technique. We place light
        sources to make light rays bounce around objects, then we compute the
        exact way the object should look, how it’s shadows should be, just how
        much it shines - essentially a very similar process to how we see on a
        biological level, except it involves an obscene amount of computational
        power, some incredible algorithms and a lot of software magic and
        emulation to achieve the end result - which is, quite frankly, an
        incredible sight to behold. Seriously, if you’re any bit interested in
        this particular field you may have already perused through the absolute
        fountain of internet memes involving RTX ON / OFF, but let me assure
        you, corporate speak aside, the actual end results are stunning and are
        immediately obvious. RT is most definitely THE FUTURE of 3D rendering,
        it’s just a question of mass adoption and a function of time - in the
        meantime, you can already enjoy some gloriously ray traced animated
        movies that took something like 1000 days or so for each 3D frame to be
        rendered - which kind of brings it all back to why rendering games at a
        playable 60+ FPS with RT on requires such massive amounts of
        computational power and the obscene cost in the present market.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">
        So where does all of this lead you, the consumer?
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Well, if you really just want some decent card that can play games,
        don’t buy a card just for the RT aspects - you will be disappointed and
        will be left with a kidney (or possibly both) sold off.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        In the long run, though, RT is definitely a huge game changer and
        something we should all be looking forward to, especially with the
        latest generation of consoles looking to have native support built in,
        which will, for sure, facilitate a lot of market adoption among
        developers and consumers alike.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Thus as we come to a close here, I hope that we all can leave a bit more
        geeked out than when we arrived here!
