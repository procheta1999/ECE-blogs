        A.I. has become a defining issue of our time, affecting national security, economic development, human rights, social media and many other domains. The ever increasing hype around AI is being used by virtually every industry and sector to add “freshness” to their product and services lineup. They argue that never has the term AI meant so little, while it should be the most prominent thing we should consider for advances now-a-days. 	
    
    </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">In the here and now, artificial intelligence — machine learning — is still something new that often goes unexplained or under-examined. ... In the future, it’ll be so normal you won’t even notice. </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        AI is everywhere in tech right now, said to be powering everything from your TV to your toothbrush, but never have the words themselves meant less. This is what’s happening in artificial intelligence right now. It is shaping many industries even when it’s new compared to other technologies. AI is also growing as scientists and engineers are doing research at a rapid pace. Companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and others are also investing heavily in AI research, and the results are quite evident. The release of self-driving cars is just an example of rapid AI growth.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Machine Learning is one way of building such systems based on providing the computer with examples of what it should do, and let it figure out Machine learning is the study of making decisions under uncertainty: given a training dataset, how should I act when I see something new - and trust me this technology is the new black. But it is truly intimidating to explore these domains, especially if you are a newbie. Reason being there is no foolproof roadmap to master AI or be a skilled Data Scientist, the skills and tools needed are dynamic. Machine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster, more accurate results in order to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also require additional time and resources to train it properly. Combining machine learning with AI and cognitive technologies can make it even more effective in processing large volumes of information. 

      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">There are things that we hear so frequently that we understand them as fact. For instance, if you crack your knuckles too often, you will develop arthritis. However, we cannot take everything we hear at face value — because it is not always true. A perfect example of this is what we have been taught to believe about how machine learning works.

    </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
       By now, there are a number of opinions about machine learning that many believe as fact. These include:
        <br><br>
       
        • Machine learning will eventually develop a human level of intelligence. 
        <br>
        • Machine learning requires no human intervention to operate. 
        <br>
        • Machine learning guarantees a high level of accuracy. 
        <br>
        • Machine learning models automatically improve over time. 
        <br><br>
        
        But are these statements fact or are they fiction? A simple breakdown of the artificial intelligence technique will tell you all you need to know.

   
    </p>
      
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">THE TRUTH ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING: </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Like many other technologies, machine learning (ML) offers great promise for businesses across several use cases — but not all of them. Despite the hype generated by the Big Tech marketing machine, it’s often not the best solution for analyzing unstructured information. For example, IBM’s Watson does not think or reason nor does GPT-3. Not today , nor in the near future. This is a fact. The problem is, no one wants to talk about it. 

      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        At its core, machine learning is “one way of programming a computer to execute a task.” So, before you dive into how ML works, it’s important that you set the right expectations about its potential impact on your business. 
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">It’s easy to get the impression that computers could become very intelligent. In a sense, they can and already are. Where people become misguided is their belief that computers can reach (or even surpass) a human level of intelligence via AI and machine learning. The truth is machine learning has little to do with human intelligence. Rather, it is a technology that “learns” through training and processes specific inputs to apply text analysis. 
        </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Although there are several machine learning techniques, they all share one common thread: they are driven by statistics and co-occurrences. In layman’s terms, ML does not have any embedded knowledge. Rather, it requires a set of documents to train the model — and usually the larger the set of documents, the better. 
        <br>
        Training a machine learning algorithm is not a straightforward task. It not only requires that you obtain immense amounts of data, but manually pre-tag every data set as well. Tagging is a very time- and labor-intensive process too, not a one-time deal. Regardless, it is necessary as it provides your algorithm with the parameters needed to extract key information and categorize it to your needs.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">Only after processing numerous documents and assessing both co-occurrences and keyword frequency will a system recognize the topic of the document. Even then, it is no guarantee you will achieve the results you set out for. Per a survey by Dimensional Research and Alegion, 96% of companies have run into training-related problems with data quality, labeling required to train the AI, and building model confidence. </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The accuracy level of a trained ML system is reliant on several factors, with the quality and volume of training data chief among them. However, it’s important to note that neither of these factors are mutually exclusive. Quality determines how representative your training documents are of the specific jargon you wish to extract from them. Volume determines the frequency of the jargon that the machine can learn from. 

      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
      Selecting the right mix of training documents is key, but it is difficult to get right. More often than not, you will experience either:

      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">• Underfitting: The training documents cannot sufficiently train your model. 
        <br>
        • Overfitting: The training documents train your model well, but only on select documents. As a result, new documents fed to it cannot be accurately processed. 
        </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">Even if you do select the right mix of data, machine learning models must frequently be retrained to maintain their level of quality. Rather than data being consistent, it remains a variable that requires oversight. </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">For machine learning systems, there are simply no tools with which to refine the algorithm. The only option you have is to feed the algorithm more examples. Unfortunately, this doesn’t guarantee improvement or that you will reach the required level of accuracy. Not to mention, if any mistakes are discovered or the trained system needs to be modified for any reason, the entire process resets to square one.</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">If AI were to develop to the point that it can do everything better than humans, it would mean that it would also do better in science and technology. It may decide that it is no longer worthwhile to develop a certain field of research - or it may decide space travel is a waste of time as long as humans on earth are living in poverty and more than a billion people have no access to clean drinking water. Most scenarios about future AI are hypothetical, but AI presents us with existential questions. It shows that where science stops, philosophy and spirituality begin.</p>
