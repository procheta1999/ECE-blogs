        Nanotechnology refers to the manipulation of materials on an atomic or
        molecular scale specifically with at least one dimension sized from 1 to
        100 nanometres such that they bring down serious, professional, and
        industrial level workload with a hundred percent efficiency and accuracy
        every single time.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Inspired by Feynman’s previous concepts, the term “nanotechnology” was
        first used by Norio Taniguchi in 1974. K. Eric Drexler used the term
        “nanotechnology” in his 1986 book Engines of creation: The coming era of
        nanotechnologies, In the book, he proposed the term and idea of a
        nanoscale “assembler” which would be able to perform controlled
        duplication of itself and other components identical to it.

        Among the wide range of practically projected as well as hypothetical
        uses of nanotechnology straight from the scripts of a Sci-fi movie, the
        most prominent is its usage in the medical field which includes
        controlled nanobots flowing through the human bloodstream to transport
        the drug required to the exact target spots.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The next prolific use of nanotechnology in the medical field is the
        surgery room to extend the reach of specially trained surgeons such that
        they can operate on the most delicate and manually unreachable spots in
        the human body with the highest efficiency ever using specially designed
        bots specifically for this purpose.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Scientists nowadays are extending the applications of nanotechnology in
        cancer treatment as well. Nanotubes can help with cancer treatment. They
        have been shown to be effective tumour killers in those with kidney or
        breast cancer. Multi-walled nanotubes are injected into a tumour and
        treated with a special type of laser that generates near-infrared
        radiation for around half a minute
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        This technology has improved the field of construction as well, by
        applying this tech, materials can gain a range of new properties. This
        discovery of a highly ordered crystal nanostructure of amorphous C-S-H
        gel and the application of photocatalyst and coating technology gave
        birth to a new generation of materials with properties like water
        resistance, self-cleaning property, wear resistance, and corrosion
        protection. The invention of Graphene has also boosted this field,
        claimed to be the most conductive, flexible, and strong material to ever
        exist in a single atomic layer and is expected to be the future of all
        gadget constructions.

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Nanotech knowledge is rapidly growing and is expected to peak in the
        next century. The number of scientific publications and fantasy articles
        in the field grew from about 200 in 1997 to more than 12,000 in 2002.
        Despite this, the technology is still in the laboratory research papers,
        hence relatively few products using nanoparticles are currently on the
        market. On the whole, the ones that are already on sale do not address
        the issues highlighted above, of health, food security, and the
        environment. Rather, the product usage range has tried to remain focused
        on consumer applications that include improved sunscreens,
        crack-resistant paints, and scratch-proof spectacle lenses. Like
        electricity and the internal combustion engine, nanotechnology is an
        enabling technology. As such, it is predicted to precipitate a range of
        innovations.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The evolution of technology is constant, Nanotechnology is one of the
        most hyped technologies among the million other fields. The future
        expects a lot from it and within another million hypotheses of its pros
        and cons, it is hoped to bloom for the betterment of society and
        humanity.
