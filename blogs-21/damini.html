      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"> What do you mean by embedded systems security? </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6"> Embedded Systems are usually open to various malicious threats and activities. The specific
        field of cybersecurity that prevents unwanted access to various embedded systems and related malicious behavior
        is known as embedded systems security. System designers work hard with security specialists to mitigate the
        impact when such attacks occur in real-time. Generally, software and physical securities are the two types of
        security frameworks applicable to any embedded system. </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Security Type: Physical</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6"> Any unauthorized use can be prevented from using the embedded systems, stealing any
        information, or destroying it, by using physical securities such as CCTV surveillance systems or locked up
        doors. Many memory technology applications are immutable and can be used as physical security devices. For
        example, sensitive data and code is protected using security enclaves and key stores which are protected. We
        also have tamper-resistant memory and keys of secure bootloaders stored in efuses. But one of the major
        disadvantages of physical security is that it cannot be useful for sensitive equipment and areas. </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Security Type: Software</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6"> Malicious attacks may occur in the system while coding runtime or during the initialization
        procedure. Hence, we have software security to respond and activate countermeasures during such problems. A few
        examples of this kind of security include device authentication in a particular network, software system
        hardening, and network trafficking through firewalls. </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold"> How Do Cyber Criminals Exploit Embedded Systems? </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6"> The first step which cybercriminals take is to get access to the network followed by proper
        learning of the embedded OS, hardware, and other important processes. Next, they keep on looking for any
        vulnerable spot in the embedded OS, PLCs, or Programmable Logic Controllers or any middleware which serves as
        the host protection. The next step is to manipulate the entire controller system through the vulnerable spot
        following by exploitation of the vulnerability to launch a malicious cyber-attack. </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Four Attack Vectors Of Embedded Systems</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6"> There are four ways through which a cyber threat can access the embedded system. Firstly,
        the threat keeps on looking for already present vulnerabilities in the system. Secondly, if any physical disk or
        USB device already possesses malicious code, then it will be easier for the threat to attack. They might even
        attack through the original host containing the embedded systems. Lastly, another important attacking path is
        through the internet connection or web server connecting other devices with the embedded system. </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Embedded Security Practices</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6"> Let’s now discuss some of the best-embedded security practices that you might perform to
        keep your OS protected. <ul>
          <li>If you run a microkernel OS, then the hacker can only attack one component at one time. Services like
            stacks of network, drivers, and user-space file systems along with small kernel space are the structure of a
            microkernel OS. The attack surface is reduced and the security increases as lesser code run in kernel space.
          </li>
          <li>Cloud vendors, software, and hardware security techniques should all work simultaneously to provide proper
            protection to the embedded OS. Hardware technologies include file systems in encrypted form, boot
            integration, access policies, thread-level detection, space path control, key management, rootless
            execution, and more.</li>
          <li>The signature given by a device trust anchor is leveraged by security booting. ∙ An HSM is used to carry
            out decryption and encryption processes, key management, embeds the OS keys, and more applications. </li>
          <li>Particular memory portions are marked as non-executable by the Executable Space Protection. An exception
            will be raised if anyone tries to execute machine code in that particular section.</li>
          <li>A stack buffer overflow is detected by stack canaries present in the OS before executing the malware code.
          </li>
          <li>The stack’s base address is allocated by address space layout randomization at first. Every time during
            the execution of a new process, shared and heaped memory locations are moved to new regions. This will
            automatically make overflow buffer attacks much difficult. The exact location of the information can never
            be predicted by any threat holder.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Why Securing An Embedded System Is Necessary?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">There are plenty of next-generation embedded systems and devices that perform heavy-duty
        functions and are complicated interconnected computers. Incorporating security into such systems requires a
        skilled design mentality. It is always very important to safeguard the embedded OS from any cyber-attacks and
        such security features must be implemented beforehand.</p>
