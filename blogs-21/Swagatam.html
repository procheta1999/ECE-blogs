        As the COVID-19 cases continue to rise across our planet,every sector of
        the infrastructure is working hard to develop innovative solutions to
        fight the coronavirus pandemic.Pandemics,Epidemics and endemic had been
        threatening the homo sapiens since the dawn of human race.We have faced
        unexpected diseases such as SARS,Ebola,H1NI which have shown their
        outrage and have potentially destroyed the lives of millions of
        people.As a Engineering student it is my prime responsibility to bring
        to light the boon of converging technology such as cloud
        computing,Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence,Robotics and high
        speed 5G internet connection that are the best innovative response to
        combat the COVID-19 situation.Since the beginning of 2020 the Covid-19
        virus has brought the world to a standstill but we are also finding out
        many innovative ways to combat the situation so that we all can return
        back to our normal lives once again.

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Wrong information about diagnosis,treatment
        techniques,vaccines,medicines and other various medical regulations
        creates more confusion and panic situation among the people.Social media
        platforms such as Google,Facebook and Youtube are tirelessly guiding
        people so that they get the right,proper and verified informations from
        accurate sources such as WHO(World Health Organization) or local
        authorities.The benefit of getting the right information plays an
        important role in creating a transparent situation in which people can
        get a clear idea about the current scenario and the treatment options.

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Drones and robots can help to deliver essential goods and accessories
        avoiding human contact.We can use Drones to deliver test kits,medicines
        and sanitization products.Autonomous vehicles help to transport COVID
        infected people to quarantine zones without human intervention which can
        help to reduce the number of daily cases.Drones equipped with thermal
        scanning technologies can identify huge crowds and gatherings and help
        to reduce the rapid spread of the virus.Robots can be used for
        sterilizing hospitals,delivering food to the infected people.They can
        also be used for sample testing and vaccine production.Thus robots and
        automation technologies can help solve many problems without risking the
        lives of many people.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Artificial Intelligence based data analytics is becoming an essential
        part of the healthcare system to combat Covid-19 situation.Face
        Recognition technology help a lot in accurately identifying people to
        find out whether they are wearing mask or not.Risk assessment and
        forecasting can also be done through Artificial Technology for
        predictive modelling are helping medical professionals a lot to know
        more about the disease and to discover more efficient methods to combat
        the current situation.Many Artificial Intelligence based tools are
        efficient in differentiating the infected people from the non-infected
        people.

        As the number of Cocid-19 cases are increasing the business world is
        taking the support of new technologies that conducts virtual
        meeting,cloud conferencing and augmented reality to make work from home
        more comfortable and efficient.Remote working is the best step to reduce
        the number of daily cases and maintain social distancing among people.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        With the increase of the number of Covid-19 cases, technologies ranging
        from AI to robotics,the arena of innovations is helping us to manage the
        pandemic situation and help us to be more defensive against such viruses
        in future.
