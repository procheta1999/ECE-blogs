        DLSS is known as deep learning super sampling which is used to increase
        resolution of game or movie without increasing load on gpu linearly. It
        is developed by Nvidia. The “super sampling” part refers to an
        anti-aliasing method that smooths the jagged edges that show up on
        rendered graphics. Over other forms of anti-aliasing, though, super
        sampling anti-aliasing which works by rendering the image at a much
        higher resolution and then using that data to fill in the gaps at the
        native resolution.
        <br /><br />
        DLSS is the result of Nvidia’s A.I. algorithm to generate better-looking
        image in games. After rendering the game at a lower resolution, DLSS
        work out the information from its knowledge base of image training, to
        generate an image at a higher resolution. DLSS 2.0 offers 4x resolution
        which allows you which can upscale games from 1080p to 4k resolution. It
        works like accumulation temporal anti-aliasing, where many frames from
        are queued up and information from these frames is then used to create
        more smooth lines and add detail into an image - but instead of adding
        detail to an image of the same resolution as TAA does, DLSS generates a
        much higher output resolution instead. Which helps in reducing problem
        such as ghosting. As many of these frames are from the past, motion
        vectors from those frames for every object and pixel on screen are
        integral for DLSS working properly. All of this information is then used
        to create the upscaled image with the help of AI program running on the
        GPU, which is accelerated by the tensor cores. Tensor core is mainly
        used to do matrix multiplication at much higher rate which is integral
        to neural network. So, while DLSS has fewer base pixels to work from, it
        has accessed a vast amount of compute power to help the reconstruction
        process’s forces a game to render at a lower resolution and then uses
        its trained A.I. algorithm to work out what it would look like if it
        were rendered at a higher one. It does this by utilizing some
        anti-aliasing effects and some sharpening method. Visual relics that
        would not be present at higher resolutions are removed and even used to
        work out the details that should be present in an image.
        <br /><br />
        DLSS is great in theory, but early version(DLSS 1.0) has lot of
        limitation in practice. DLSS 1.0 could only be trained on a per game
        basis—which means Nvidia needed to devote its entire supercomputer’s
        power to each game that uses the technology. Meanwhile, for DLSS 2.0
        Nvidia claims that it uses a fundamentally different AI model that is
        twice as fast. It accumulates data from multiple frames to generate its
        high-quality output frame, then feeds that frame back into the model to
        help inform the next frame. This increases the amount of data going into
        the AI model, which helps Nvidia generate higher-quality images. They
        can use a universal network for DLSS 2.0, instead of requiring per game
        training. And because the new AI model uses tensor core much more
        efficiently, DLSS 2.0 is almost twice as fast as DLSS 1.0.
        <br /><br />
        Throughout the future, DLSS will continue to improve because it operates
        though neutral network.
