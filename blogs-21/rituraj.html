        A computer, as the name suggests, is a device that computes! It can
        compute and process millions of instructions all the same time to
        accomplish a certain task. Well, how is a computer capable of executing
        such a massive number of instructions without complaining? The answer is
        “CPU (Central Processing Unit)” or the brain of a computer. It can
        handle lots and lots of complicated instructions and can solve super
        difficult mathematical calculations in just a matter of seconds. Smart
        right? But CPUs aren’t really useful while dealing with tasks like
        Graphics rendering. In simple terms, CPUs can’t control graphics on
        screen efficiently. Here’s where a GPU comes into action!
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        GPU is the acronym for Graphics Processing Unit. It’s actually a
        processor, just like a CPU. GPU is the processing unit of a device
        called Graphics card which is dedicated for graphics, specifically for
        images that deal with the 3D world.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        But wait! What’s the purpose of introducing a separate hardware for
        rendering graphics on screen? Engineers could have easily added a new
        processor slot in the computer hardware which could be defined for
        graphics processing only. Then why do we have to install a graphics card
        to improve graphics performance?
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Well, both CPU and GPU appear to be very similar. Both are silicon based
        microprocessors mounted on a PCB with heat sinks. But they differ in
        their architecture. The number of cores in a GPU is greater than the
        number of cores in a CPU. But each CPU core is way more powerful than a
        GPU core. This is because CPU is used for logic and instruction which
        can get very complicated. CPU cores can carry out millions of
        instructions per second but can only perform one task at a time. In
        graphics rendering, the calculations aren’t really complicated, but
        there are lots of them.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        So making use of CPU cores to perform plenty of simple calculations to
        render graphics would eventually turn out to be inefficient and it will
        take a lot of time (CPU cores being less in number).
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        On the other hand, GPUs can handle a lot of calculations since it has a
        large number of cores. Also, the calculations are not aren’t that
        complicated. In 3D, everything is made up of small triangles having
        coordinates. The vertices of each triangle need to be processed for
        motion and scaling (transformation). GPUs are actually good in solving
        problems like Vector operations, matrices and simple geometry which are
        essential in 3D graphics. These are simple but numerous. That’s why GPUs
        are used in graphics processing.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Now we know that a GPU is the processing unit of a graphics card. But
        what about its memory? How does a GPU receive data for graphics
        processing? Just like our computer has a primary memory called RAM,
        graphics cards have Video RAM or VRAM which can store a small number of
        accessible data. Now-a-days, most of the computer games require graphics
        card to run. This is because a lot of graphics and calculations are
        involved in modern day games. For example, the NVIDIA GT 1030 graphics
        card has 2GB VRAM.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        But do we use GPUs only for gaming? The answer is No! GPU is actually a
        processor which can solve simple problems but more in number. So, GPUs
        can also be used for activities like video editing (some of the features
        in Adobe Premiere Pro won’t run without a GPU), Bitcoin mining, etc.
        Basically, it is designed for parallel processing.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Currently, NVIDIA is ruling the market with its new generation graphics
        cards called the RTX graphics cards introduced in 2018. RTX graphics
        cards are based on a new generation architecture called the “Turing”
        architecture. Like the RTX 2080 has 4352 CUDA (Compute Unified Device
        Architecture) cores with a boost speed of 1635 MHz while the GTX 1080 Ti
        has 3584 cores running at 1585 Mhz. Also the RTX graphics cards are
        better than the GTX ones. This is because, apart from the usual CUDA
        cores, RTX cards also have Tensor cores for Machine Learning and RT
        cores for real time ray tracing. Also it comes with the new GDDR6 memory
        which increases the memory bandwidth.
