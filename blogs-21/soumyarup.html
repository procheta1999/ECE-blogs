        Augmented reality is a part of immersive technology that can be
        considered as a blessing in our daily life because it helps us improve
        our real-life experiences with the detailed description they are capable
        of providing.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Augmented reality presents computer-generated augmentation on our
        present reality which helps us perform tasks better and with efficiency.
        Augmented reality acts as a bridge between virtual reality and our real
        world, rendering and mixing up data and parameters from both sections
        with high efficiency.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The development of the AR technology is not something new; it originated
        in 1968 on which professor Ivan Sutherland built the first AR device
        “The sword of Damocles” which used computer graphics wires to form
        drawings.
      </p>

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The utmost capabilities of the present-day AR technology have been
        presented to us in the form of a game Pokémon Go Developed by Niantic
        which has rendered the real-world data to the virtual world of the
        Pokémon giving us a feeling as if the Pokémon are roaming around us or
        the poke gym is located near me. This was an example where the
        real-world information is hired for the virtual world but in the case of
        google map, the case is almost the opposite where AR technology is used
        to show us information about a place or are virtually by presenting it
        in the real world of ours helping us to know more a place or to find a
        place with ease. AR helps brands provide a unique experience to the
        customer by providing detailed information about a particular product
        reducing the difference between purchase and dropout.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The hardware requirements of augmented reality are not something out of
        access which includes processor display sensors and input devices and
        display systems attached to the human body. The best use of AR is the
        helmet-mounted display which must be worn on the forehead. It places the
        virtual object in the real world in the user's field of view. Specific
        providers like uSnsen and gestures include gesture controls for full
        virtual immersions. The project of the use of AR in contact lenses is in
        progress. The first working prototype of the AR lens with no use of
        glasses was developed by Mojo visions in 2020.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The advancement in AR is also known as AR 2.0 which is the blending of
        the real world with the virtual world. Unlike AR, users can effectively
        interact with the virtual objects and place them in the desired place or
        give a shape of their own.AR2.0 is also known as mixed reality (MR). The
        future of AR 2.0 is not so distant and large companies knowing this fact
        invested up to 4billion dollars on AR and MR. It has been used widely in
        surgery, sports, construction, and design. The most famous MR design
        which is now present is the Microsoft hololens which is a pair of MR
        programmed glasses that allows us to experience 3D holograms blended
        into our real environment which allows us to interact with the models
        and get all the detailed information we need.
      </p>

          >Hope this innovation will reach its peak in the coming days, and we
          will be able to obtain the maximum benefit from it.
