        A Gattaca-like future is not a dystopian myth anymore. It is closer than
        we think and I’m talking reverse ageing, living for centuries, a proper
        cure for numerous diseases like Alzheimer’s, superfood and designer
        babies. Sounds like science fiction right. The trendiest hot topic for
        the science community is CRISPR technology, mankind’s newest invention
        can modify/create any or every DNA sequence to alter a single gene or
        the embryo completely. Humanity has levelled up to the big leagues and
        we’re now is a step closer to ‘playing god’. The year is 2020 and the
        biotechnician’s favourite game ‘build-a-gene’ finally wins a Nobel
        prize.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">What is CRISPR/-Cas9 ?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        CRISPR technology is a simple and affordable way to manipulate and edit
        DNA, changing the face of genome editing forever. The uses of this
        technology are limitless. Researchers are studying new treatments for
        diseases such as cancer, blindness and Alzheimer's. Scientists are also
        studying CRISPR to develop more sustainable fuel and chemical production
        methods and improve food crops. CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly
        Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. Our distant prokaryotic cousins,
        bacteria, are like vaccines that can protect themselves from
        bacteriophages, which are actually tiny viruses that attack bacteria.
        This process is called CRISPR/cas9, or more commonly CRISPR, which means
        regular palindrome iteration. When a phage attacks a bacterium, it
        injects its DNA-carrying phage into a human host cell like a virus. If
        the bacterium survives the infection, it will take a small part of the
        phage DNA and build it into itself The subsequent protection is similar
        to the way our bodies make and use antibodies. The acronym CRISPR above
        describes the process of incorporating phage DNA into the bacterial
        genome. Bacteriophages are the most populous organisms on earth!- DNA
        and transcribes it into a small piece of RNA, which is another genetic
        material similar to DNA. Together with a protein called Cas9 and several
        other factors, the RNA can find the DNA of the invading phage and cut it
        into two halves. Before the bacteria can destroy it again.

        Little background information to spice things up
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        So, why are we so curious about the process of using tiny bacteria that
        we can't even see? How does this help us? The answer can be summed up in
        two words: gene editing. Obviously, bacteria have been using CRISPR, and
        scientists have known this process since the 1990s. It was not until
        2012 that scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna
        described the biochemical characteristics of the CRISPR/cas9 system and
        described how the process can be used to manipulate genes in other
        organisms. In 2013, a scientist at MIT named Feng Zhang successfully
        used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to manipulate the human genome. Indeed,
        Doudna, Charpentier and Zhang put forward theories and showed that RNA
        instead of bacteriophage DNA, just like in bacterial cells, we can learn
        from the human genome. RNA is extracted from the DNA of a specific gene
        (or the genome of another gene). Biology) and use the Cas9 protein to
        delete the gene.-Cas9 genome editing technology was awarded the 2020
        Nobel Prize in Chemistry by Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">How does it work?</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The splendour of CRISPR lies in its simplicity. CRISPR is based on just
        two components: the molecular scissors, a CRISPR-associated (Cas)
        nuclease, and the GPS guiding it to the appropriate site, the guide RNA
        (gRNA). In nature, the gRNA includes two distinct segments of RNA:
        CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA).
        Synthetically, they can be engineered as one seamless fusion sequence
        known as single guide RNA (sgRNA). Once the target gene and Cas nuclease
        have been selected, the next essential step is to design the specific
        guide RNA sequence. Several software tools exist for designing an
        optimal guide with minimum off-target effects and maximum on-target
        efficiency. The following tools are the most popular guide RNA design
        tools available are Synthego Design Tool, Desktop Genetics and
        Benchling.

      <p class="lead fs-4 fw-bold">Application and future scope</p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Genome editing is of great interest in the prevention and treatment of
        human diseases. Currently, most research on genome editing is done to
        understand diseases using cells and animal models. Scientists are still
        working to determine whether this approach is safe and effective for use
        in people. It is being explored in research on a wide variety of
        diseases, including single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis,
        haemophilia, and sickle cell disease. It also holds promise for the
        treatment and prevention of more complex diseases, such as cancer, heart
        disease, blindness, mental illness, and human immunodeficiency virus
        (HIV) infection. A new super race maybe (so like the ultimate desire of
        that one German Führer perhaps)that was dark. Moving on, this technology
        could possibly go on to create genetically engineered human beings that
        are perfection personified, quite literally 'superman'. It can be used
        to make crops that last longer, have more nutrients and whatnot.
        Basically we can use the software to change the gene structure of the
        crops in any way we want. This pretty much gives a new meaning to
        hybridisation in plants.

      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Many people are concerned with the ethical, legal and moral aspects of
        this technology. Some believe that when this tech moves out of the labs
        to commercial use, it will be expensive which will raise a new term
        'genetic inequality'. Experts believe that this could add to the
        pre-existing social dichotomy between the haves and the have-nots. But
        like all things currently existing in our world, this technology too has
        good and bad sides. A simple paracetamol tablet can cause nausea and in
        worst cases jaundice, but it also helps with our headaches and fevers.
        One can and maybe will use this technology in the future to create
        something thing deadly ( like a virus perhaps or gene weapons to aid
        bio-warfare). But this same tech has the potential to cure and remove
        cancer. History bears witness to the fact that every new invention was
        met with a radical backlash of the ignorant. Scientific truth never won
        over the ignorant by making them see the light. The stupid ones
        eventually died and the next generation grew up being familiar with it.
        No research or discovery can be entirely good or evil as George Bernard
        Shaw had rightfully claimed 'Science never solves a problem without
        creating ten more.'
