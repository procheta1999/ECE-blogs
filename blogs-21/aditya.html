      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Thanks to IoT that nowadays humans are a click away from almost every
        action or information in the world. Introduction of smartphones and good
        internet connectivity has helped more and more people to connect with
        the world around them, know other people and has opened a variety of new
        job options. IoT has a very important role to play in our day to day
        lives for example smart speakers like google home or Alexa, home
        security systems , smartlocks and many more. The IoT device basically
        collects valuable information about the users for example their
        behavior, preferences , interests and then shows suitable results. This
        has led to the introduction of a new technology known as Internet of
        Behaviour or IoB. The Covid 19 pandemic has brought about s huge change
        around the world, especially in the way people communicate . That is why
        IoB has become one the latest trends of 2021, as it helps people
        communicate with the companies during these situations, as a result of
        which most companies are looking forward to IoB.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        IoB is an extension of IoT which mainly focuses on people's behavior. It
        gives vast data and information about user's behavior, preferences and
        interests which helps optimizing the user's search experience.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        According to Gartner, IoB combines technologies focused on tracking
        location and facial recognition of the people, connecting the data, and
        mapping them to behavioral events. IoB is a process where user data is
        analyzed in terms of behavioral psychology. Based on this analysis, new
        approaches to the development of user experience (UX), search experience
        optimization (SXO), and end products and companies' services and how to
        promote them are formed. Implementing IoB is pretty simple as it
        requires statistical studies like mapping everyday behavior of users
        following the privacy agreement for legal reasons. IoB helps in
        analyzing human behaviour and accordingly improvises the search results
        so that the person can get better and accurate results everytime he
        wants something. In this pandemic situation since everything is becoming
        online, people tend to shop online, work online even open new companies
        online, that's why IoB plays a major role in today's world. It helps
        promote these companies or suggests a product for shopping depending on
        the user's behavior. This results in better user experience and also
        accurate promotion of the companies or product. The main of objective of
        IoB is to improve efficiency and quality of the system . IoB mainly
        comprises of technology , data analytics and behavorial science. It
        guides the customer throughout the process of suggesting a suitable
        product according to his needs to buying it and delivering it.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        A basic example of IoB would be a heath app like healthify me which
        tracks your day to day activities and calorie intake and suggests you
        what should be done to make you more healthy. It shows how the app
        analyses the behavior of the user and accordingly shows the exact
        information that the user needs to improve his helath.
