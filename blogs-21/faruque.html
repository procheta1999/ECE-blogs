        Let’s talk about the birth and journey of higher programming languages
        and how we came along from ‘FORTRAN’ to ‘Julia’, the language of the
        future.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        The original plan for developing FORTRAN was put up by IBM in 1953. It
        was commercially released in 1957, marking the birth of computer
        software. Before FORTRAN, computer programming was done in machine
        language, a cumbersome and complex set of instructions; to be honest,
        you don’t really want to talk about it.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        FORTRAN came, removing these statements by a factor of 20 and claimed
        the title of “1st widely used cross-platform language”. Though it only
        had 32 statements upon its release, did only a fundamental basic ‘block
        program’ (one Entry and one Exit), and was still using ‘punch card code’
        (IBM 206 keypunch). Logical IF statement came five years later in 1962
        with FORTRAN IV.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        After a decade of its commercial release FORTRAN first became business
        standard and after two decades of its commercial release functions like
        ‘else if’, ‘do loop’ was invoked into FORTRAN. 1977 became the first
        year to finally introduce ‘data types’ to replace Hollerith strings. And
        finally in 1990 dynamic memory allocation, pointers, nullity, recursion
        was introduced; things we can’t write good programs without.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Time traveling to six decades later, we’re still using FORTRAN but along
        with it we have Julia, possibly the most hybrid and efficient language
        to this date.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Julia was first released in 2012 and had been in work since 2009 with
        contributors like Viral B. Shah (an Indian computer scientist, and
        current Julia CEO). It was created to be fast (high performance),
        dynamic (dynamically typed), reproducible (reproducible environment with
        pre-built binaries), composable (uses multiple dispatches as a
        paradigm), and generic.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Julia makes it possible to build complete applications with the help of
        its long list of APIs, offering Dash.jl for web UI, QML.jl for native
        UI, and foreign function interfaces for C, Python, and even FORTRAN. The
        Julia ecosystem provides CSV.jl, a multi-threaded package to read CSV
        files, and JDBC.jl or ODBC.jl packages to work with almost any database.
        The MLJ.jl package provides a unified interface to common machine
        learning algorithms. Julia is designed to be very good at numerical and
        scientific computing and has an ecosystem for biology (BiloJulia),
        astronomy (JuliaAstro), ecology (EcoJulia), and many more. Packages such
        as DistributedArrays.jl and Dagger.jl helps Julia to provide built-in
        primitives at each level. MPL.jl brings in MPL style parallelism to
        Julia.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Unlike other languages, Julia doesn’t do a trade-off between speed and
        beauty. It offers features with simplicity. It does high-level numerical
        computing like MATLAB, R, and Python but also borrows much from popular
        dynamic languages, including Perl, Lua, Ruby, etc. Therefore, it’s easy
        to write code that is as much fast as C. An example of this “good of
        both worlds” feature is a package like Plots.jl, which is a
        visualization and graphing toolset allowing you to view graphics and
        animation with updates in real-time.
      </p>
      <p class="lead fs-6">
        Well, there is a good 60 years of difference between both the programs,
        so comparing these two won’t be fair, but certainly not unethical. Julia
        beats FORTRAN in most of the benchmarks (reverse-complement, fasta,
        fannkuch-redux to name some) but it is FORTRAN that was the first to be
        used and demanded in scientific programming. Julia may be doing
        multi-threading just fine, but the farthest man-made objects in space,
        Voyager 1 and 2 were programmed in FORTRAN and they’re still working
        just fine as well. So, Julia may be the “Language of the future” but
        FORTRAN is still the “Mother tongue of scientific computing.”
